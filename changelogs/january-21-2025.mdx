### **‚ú® New**

1. **Resource Override Chrome Extension Importer**\
   Introduced the ability to import configurations directly from Resource Override Chrome Extension, making it easier to transition. Refer [docs](/general/imports/resource-override).

2. **Markdown Support in Collections Overview**\
   Added Markdown support for the Collection Overview tab, enabling users to format descriptions, notes, and documentation within collections.

3. **Variables Autocompletion in API Client Requests**\
   Implemented autocompletion for variables, improving speed and accuracy when working with dynamic data in requests.

### **üíé Improvements**

1. Tabs and cursor positions are now preserved when switching between API Client tabs, whereas previously, switching back to a tab would default to the query parameters view.

2. Collections are now sorted alphabetically, improving readability and ensuring easy accessibility.

3. The API Client history screen now clearly informs users that history data is stored in local storage, with a message displayed at the top.

4. Collections are now collapsed by default upon import, improving readability and reducing visual clutter compared to the previous behavior where all collections were expanded.

### **üêû Fixes**

1. Resolved an issue where unsaved changes to environment variables were lost when opening the importer modal.

2. Fixed a bug in Codemirror where the cursor jumped to the beginning of the editor when typing rapidly, improving text editing functionality.

3. Request and Response bodies in the API Client now load prettified by default, enhancing readability.

4. Secret values are no longer visible in the autocomplete dropdown of the API Client.

5. Resolved an issue where tabs would display data from a different request when switching.

6. Fixed an issue where unsaved changes to a request were lost upon duplicating it.

7. Fixed an issue where query parameters were lost when a request was loaded from history.

8. Addressed an issue where current values of API Client variables were cleared upon switching workspaces.
