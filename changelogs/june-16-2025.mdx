### **🛠️ Improvements**

* API client cookies are now set using the Set-Cookie header and are included in subsequent requests.

* API Client now shows a clearer message instead of just "Failed to fetch" when there's a DNS resolution error.

### **🐛 Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where the unsaved changes indicator didn’t disappear after saving changes with updated query parameters.

* Resolved a cursor jump issue in the editor for a smoother typing experience.

* Fixed broken key-value pair parsing that caused incorrect behavior in some rules.

* Boolean values now render properly across the app, instead of being hidden or misrepresented.
