### üõ†Ô∏è Improvements

* **Enhanced URL Field in API Client:** The smaller URL field with the new 2-column layout of API Client was causing issues in working with the URL field. The input URL field now spans the full width. It provides complete visibility and a better experience.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

* Fixed a critical issue causing crashes when displaying names.

* Fixed an issue where renaming a request caused unintended duplication.

* Status text now correctly populates in scripts, providing accurate information for debugging and development

* Addressed issues causing crashes related to undefined body in FixedRequestLogPane.js.
