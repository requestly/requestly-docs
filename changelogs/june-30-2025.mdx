### **🚀 New**

* Drag and drop support added to Collections for easier organization.

### **🛠️ Improvements**

* Windows app updated to the latest version.

* Fixed an issue where the Network Details panel would disappear from the recorded session on hover.

* Collections are now imported with the correct hierarchy and order — previously, they appeared as a flat list.
