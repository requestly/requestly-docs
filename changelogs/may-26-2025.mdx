### **🚀 New**

* You can now enable **Offline Log Storage** to stream intercepted logs directly to a local file. ([View Github Issue](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues/3002))

### **🛠️ Improvements**

* You can now serve responses from Local Files too without making a backend request.

* The rule applied widget is now more informative and easier to understand.

* Extended the support of `Ctrl/Cmd + S` save shortcut to the File Server too.

### **🐛 Fixes**

* We've resolved issues where the browser extension showed an incorrect enabled/disabled state.

* If something goes wrong while importing a cURL request, you'll now get a clear, helpful message.

* We've fixed rare crashes that occurred when using the API Client while logged out or when saving from the history view.

* Your saved workspaces now load correctly every time you launch the app, even from local files.

* When you rename an environment, the new name now updates instantly everywhere.
