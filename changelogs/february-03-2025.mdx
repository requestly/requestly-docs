### ‚ú® New

* **API Client Test Support**: You can now write and execute tests directly within API Client scripts, enabling more robust API testing workflows.

* **Client Code Snippet Generation**: Generate client code snippets for API requests with ease. Supported languages include Python, Ruby, PHP, R, and Shell. Refer [Docs](/general/api-client/generate-client-code).

* **Automated Student Access**: Students signing up on Requestly now receive lifetime free access under the [Requestly Student Program](https://requestly.com/student-program/).

### üíé Improvements

* **Enhanced API Client UI/UX**: The response and request panels are displayed side-by-side, making it easier to scan and work with a long list of headers, request or response bodies, and scripts.

### üêû Fixes

* Fixed Postman Importer issue with URL form-encoded bodies.

* Fixed rule editor crashes for users who changed the app language from English.

* Resolved API Client variable data loss in certain edge cases.

* Updated request method colors in the API Client to fix style inconsistencies.

* Fixed block list issues on the Desktop app. Both domains and their subdomains will be blocked as expected when connected via the desktop app. Previously, only the subdomains were blocked.
