If you're unable to log into Requestly, try the following troubleshooting steps:

## **Check for VPN Services**

If you are using a VPN, it may interfere with Requestly's login mechanisms, especially with Google authentication and email-based magic link delivery. Disable your VPN and try logging in again.

## **Google Authentication Failing**

In some cases, custom rules created in Requestly can interfere with Google's authentication requests. If you're unable to log in via Google Sign-In:

* Disable any active rules that may affect `google.com` or related domains.

* You can also pause the Requestly extension temporarily and attempt the login again.

* Once logged in, you can resume the extension and re-enable your rules.

## **Not Receiving Magic Link**

If you've requested a magic link and havenâ€™t received it:

* Check your spam or junk email folder.

* Make sure no VPN is active, as it may block or delay email delivery.

* Try requesting the link again after disabling your VPN.

## **Still Facing Issues?**

If login continues to fail after following the above steps, please contact Requestly Support. Include:

* The email address you are trying to log in with

* Any error messages or screenshots

* Whether any VPN or Requestly rules were active during login attempts
