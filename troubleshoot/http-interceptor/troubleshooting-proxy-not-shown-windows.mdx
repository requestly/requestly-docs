## How to check if proxy is running in the background

If you're seeing a "No Proxy" issue in the Requestly Desktop App on Windows, follow these troubleshooting steps:

### Issue Diagnosis

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check if default port 8281 is available and identify the process">
    Verify that port 8281 is not being used by another application. Open Command Prompt and run:
    ```
    netstat -ano | findstr :8281
    ```
    This will show you the Process ID (PID) using this port. Then identify which process is using the port by running (replace `7136` with the PID from the previous command):
    ```
    tasklist /FI "PID eq 7136"
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Change default proxy port if needed">
    If the port is being used by an application other than Requestly:
    - Go to Requestly Settings
    - Change the default proxy port to an available port
    <img src="/images/troubleshoot-proxy-no-shown-windows/set-default-port.webp" alt="Set Default Proxy Port" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Try manual proxy connection (if Requestly is using the port)">
    If Requestly is using port 8281 but you still see the "No Proxy" issue:
    - Get your local IP address by running `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
    - Try connecting to the proxy manually using your local IP and port 8281
    - Configure your system or browser to use this proxy: `<your-local-ip>:8281`
  </Step>
</Steps>
