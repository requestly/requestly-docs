    ```
    netstat -ano | findstr :8281
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check if Requestly.exe background process is running">
    - Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
    - Look for `Requestly.exe` in the Processes tab
    - If `Requestly.exe` is running at port 8281, it means the proxy may have started but is not available to the UI
  </Step>
</Steps>
