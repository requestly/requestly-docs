If you're unable to intercept web traffic using the Requestly Desktop App, use the following guide to identify and resolve common issues based on your interception environment.

## Identify Your Interception Environment

Determine where you're attempting to intercept traffic from:

* Desktop browsers

* System-wide traffic (entire machine)

* iOS or Android devices

* Emulators (iOS or Android)

Each environment may require different troubleshooting steps.

## Browsers and System-Wide Traffic

### Issue: Only HTTP traffic is intercepted

If HTTPS traffic is not being intercepted, this is likely due to the SSL certificate not being installed or trusted on your system.

Refer to the following guide:\
[Troubleshooting Untrusted SSL Certificate](/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-untrusted-ssl-certificate)

### Issue: Localhost traffic is not intercepted

Intercepting traffic to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` requires specific configuration.

Refer to:\
[Intercepting Requests from Localhost](/troubleshoot/intercepting-requests-from-localhost)

## Mobile Devices and Emulators

### Issue: Emulator not detected by the desktop app

In rare cases, emulator may not appear in the list of connected devices. Restarting the Requestly desktop app generally resolves this issue.

### Issue: Device is Connected, but Traffic is Not Being Intercepted

Please verify the following:

* The desktop app and mobile device are on the **same network**.

* All setup steps for the platform have been completed correctly.

* SSL certificate is trusted and localhost configuration is correct.

Refer to: Desktop App [Setup Guide](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app) for your device

### Issue: Only some mobile apps are intercepted

This typically occurs due to SSL pinning, especially on Android devices. SSL pinning prevents proxy-based tools from intercepting secure connections and is a technical limitation.

For further details, refer to:

[SSL Pinning android](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/android-devices#ssl-pinning-if-required)

## General Troubleshooting

### Blocked domains

Ensure you have not manually excluded domains from being intercepted.\
Refer to:\
[How to Avoid Intercepting Certain Domains](/guides/how-to-avoid-intercepting-certain-domains-on-the-desktop-app)

### Safari-specific issues

If you are intercepting traffic from Safari and facing issues, regenerating the certificate can help.\
Make sure to restart the app after regenerating the certificate.

Refer to:\
[Troubleshooting Safari](/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-safari)

## Still Need Help?

If you're still unable to intercept traffic, contact support with the following details:

* Platform you're trying to intercept from (browser, system-wide, mobile, or emulator)

* Network configuration

* Console or network errors (if any)

* Operating system and Requestly version
