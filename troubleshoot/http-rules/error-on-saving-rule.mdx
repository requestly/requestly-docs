## 1. Check Console for Error Details

Open the **Developer Console** in your browser (Right-click → Inspect → Console tab).\
You will find an error message logged along with the **Rule ID** that caused the issue.

This information is essential for debugging or sharing with the support team if needed.

## 2. Common Errors and Resolutions

### a. Regex Size Limit Exceeded

If the error message indicates that the regex exceeds the supported size limit, please refer to this issue for known limitations and potential workarounds:\
[Regex Size Limit Issue #1690](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues/1690)

### b. Invalid Regex / Unsupported Lookaheads

If the error message mentions *"Invalid regex"* or unsupported syntax such as **lookaheads**, it means the pattern is not compatible with the regex engine we use.

<Info>
  Requestly uses **RE2-compatible regular expressions**, as required by **Chrome's Manifest V3** security model.\
  This is a technical limitation imposed by Chrome, and not something we can bypass.
</Info>

For reference on RE2-compatible syntax, you can visit:\
[RE2 Syntax Documentation](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)

## 3. Still Facing Issues?

If your error does not fall under the above categories, or you're unsure how to proceed, please:

* Note the **error message** from the console.

* Contact our support team or file an issue with details on [GitHub](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues).
