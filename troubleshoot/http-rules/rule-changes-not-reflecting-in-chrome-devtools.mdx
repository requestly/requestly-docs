  Requestly rule changes may not show in Chrome DevTools, learn why and how to
  verify they’re working.
visibility: PUBLIC

Some rule modifications made using Requestly may **not appear** in Chrome’s Network DevTools — even though they are **successfully applied** in the background.

### Why This Happens

This primarily affects:

* **Modify Response Rule**

* **Modify Response Headers Rule**

When these rules are applied, Requestly intercepts and modifies the response **after** it has been received by the browser, but **before** it's delivered to the page. However, Chrome DevTools continues to display the **original unmodified response** because of technical limitations in the browser’s extension APIs.

In short, your modifications **do take effect**, but they **won’t be reflected** in the Network tab of DevTools.

### How to Confirm That Modifications Are Working

To verify that your rule is working as expected:

* Follow this guide to [validate rule execution in your browser](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/validate-rules-execution)[.](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/validate-rules-execution)

* Check if the application is behaving according to your changes (e.g., modified data is rendered on the page).

* Use `console.log()` or inspect values in the page context (e.g., responses received by `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`).

* Add temporary debug markers (e.g., a test field in a JSON response or a custom response header) and verify their usage in the application logic.
