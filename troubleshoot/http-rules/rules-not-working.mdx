## **Common Issues by Rule Type**

> Some rule types in Requestly have specific behaviors or limitations. Here's what you need to know for each one:

### Modify API Response

**Not visible in Chrome DevTools**\
API response modifications made by Requestly don’t show up in the browser’s DevTools, but they’re still applied in the background.

**Only works with XHR/Fetch requests**\
Modify API Response **can’t modify** HTML, CSS, or other static files in the extension. For that, use the [Desktop App](https://requestly.com/downloads/desktop/).

### Modify Response Headers

Response Headers modification done by Requestly are not visible in Browsers devtool but they are actually modified.

### Delay Request

In the browser extension, delays are automatically capped to prevent performance issues. XHR/Fetch requests can be delayed up to 5,000 ms, while other resources (like JS, CSS, images) support up to 10,000 ms. For unlimited delays, switch to the <a target="_blank" href="https://requestly.com/downloads/desktop/">Desktop App</a>.

### Insert Script Rule

**Inline JavaScript is ignored when using the URL option**\
When you choose the **URL** method, only the external script is loaded. Any inline JavaScript written between the `<script>` tags will be completely ignored by the browser

**Doesn’t run on internal browser pages**\
Scripts won’t run on pages like `chrome://`, [`file://`](file://), or other system-level pages. For testing, use a local server or the **Desktop App**.
