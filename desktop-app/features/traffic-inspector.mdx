## Introduction

Whether you’re a developer, QA engineer, or anyone working with HTTP requests and APIs, Requestly can help you intercept and analyze network traffic in real-time, making it easier to debug issues or test changes without touching the code.

## How does Requestly Interceptor work?

Requestly HTTP interceptor is a web proxy that runs on your computer. By routing network requests through Requestly, you can intercept all the network traffic made by the browser or your application.

Reading and modifying any web request and response opens up a world of possibilities for debugging and analyzing your application. You can:

* **Pinpoint Issues**: Identify network errors, slow responses, or missing resources.

* **Test Edge Cases**: Simulate server errors or unexpected payloads.

* **Inject Mock Data**: Replace live responses with custom data.

* **Optimize APIs**: Refine requests to enhance performance.

## Configure HTTP Interceptor

Requestly’s HTTP interceptor can be used with various applications and devices, Explore these guides to learn how to set it up for your specific needs.

* [Browsers](/desktop-app/setup/browsers) - Configure Requestly with popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc

* [Android devices](/desktop-app/setup/android/android-devices) - Intercept Traffic from your Android smartphones and tablets.

* [Android emulator](/desktop-app/setup/android/android-emulators) - Configure Android emulators in Android Studio.

* [iOS Devices](/desktop-app/setup/ios/ios-devices) - Set up your iPhones and iPads to intercept their traffic

* [iOS Emulator](/desktop-app/setup/ios/ios-emulators) - Use Requestly with iOS simulators in Xcode.

* [Node.js](/desktop-app/setup/nodejs) - Integrate Requestly with Node.js applications to debug server-side network requests and responses during development or testing

* [Terminal](/desktop-app/setup/terminal) - Use Requestly with command-line tools or scripts to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests for automation and debugging purposes.

* [Systemwide proxy](/desktop-app/setup/systemwide-proxy) - Configure Requestly as a systemwide proxy to capture and manipulate traffic across all applications and devices connected to your network.

After you set up your desired application to Requestly’s proxy you can easily view all the network requests and responses in the network table.

## Network Table

The **Network Table** is the heart of Requestly’s Desktop App; here you can monitor, inspect, and manage all intercepted network traffic. It’s packed with powerful features to help you debug with ease. Here's a quick overview of its key components:

1. **Traffic Table -** Displays all intercepted requests and responses with key details like URL, status, and time.

2) **Export HAR button** **-** Export captured network traffic as a HAR file for analysis or sharing. [Read more](/general/session-book/import-view-har-file).

3. **Save Session Button** **-** Save the current network session for future debugging or comparison.

4. **Request / Response Details -** Show detailed headers, payloads, and cookies for selected requests or responses.

5. **Search and Filter options -** Quickly find traffic entries using search keywords or advanced filters.

6. **Clear Logs or Pause Button -** Clears logs or pauses traffic capture to reduce noise and focus.

7. **App and Domains Filter -** Filters traffic by specific apps or domains for focused analysis.

## **Filtering Traffic**

Use the filter option to find a set of particular requests from hundreds of intercepted requests. There are 4 types of filters available as follows:

* **URL**: Filter requests by using string search on the URL of the request.

* **Method**: Filter by HTTP methods such as: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE.

* **Status Code**: Narrow down by response status codes, including 1XX (Informational), 2XX (Success), 3XX (Redirection), 4XX (Client Errors), and 5XX (Server Errors).

* **Resource Type**: Focus on specific resource types like HTML, JSON, JavaScript, CSS, Images, Media (Audio and Video), FormData, or Fonts.
