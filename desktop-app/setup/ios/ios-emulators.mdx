### Note:

In order to be able to intercept traffic from the running simulators, Requestly sets the systemwide proxy on your device, which is why you might see many network logs from other sources that are making web requests on your device.

You can filter through this noise by selecting the specific iOS app from the filters in the sidebar or<a target="_blank" href="/desktop-app/features/traffic-inspector">use the other filters</a> that are available in the traffic inspector
