You can use Requestly to both inspect and modify all the traffic going through your device (whether itâ€™s Windows, MacOS or Linux)

1. Download the Requestly Desktop App

2. Launch the app and Click on the `Connect App` button on the top to see the sources that you can intercept into Requestly.

3. Select the `System Wide` proxy option,

   1. It will ask you for your password the first time. This is to allow the system to trust our CA certificate (which makes it possible to modify your https requests using Requestly)

4. Inspect all the traffic of your device inside the `Network Inspector`

### For linux users:

If you are a linux user, it is possible that the `System Wide` proxy option is not visible to you. This is because there is no one way to setup a system proxy for linux desktops.

You can follow this guide that tries to cover most of the common ways:

Whatever the way to set the proxy, you will need the proxy variables (IP and port) from our app
