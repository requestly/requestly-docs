## Introduction

When working with Android apps, debugging HTTP Requests can be a challenge. Requestly provides an easy-to-use solution for everyone who needs to monitor, modify, or debug HTTP requests and responses during development or QA testing. This section outlines step-by-step instructions, guiding you on how to set up Requestly for your Android emulator.

By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional interception setup tailored for your Android development needs.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

## Automatic Setup

Requestly offers a one-click setup for Android emulators using Desktop App version **1.7.0+**. Here's how:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Your Android Emulator">
    Ensure your emulator is up and running before proceeding
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Requestly Desktop App">
    Launch the Requestly desktop application on your computer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click any one of the Connect Apps buttons from the network table as shown below">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Here go to Mobiles apps and you should be able to see all Android emulators running on your device simply click on connect">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Setup

If the automatic setup does not work for you, you can manually configure the proxy by following these steps:

If you have ADB installed, you can skip the proxy setup through the emulator's UI by running the following command in your android studio terminal:

```bash
adb shell settings put global http_proxy "<ip>:<port>"
```

<Info>
  Make sure to change the : in the above command to the one mentioned in the header of Requestly desktop app
</Info>

Otherwise, follow these steps to configure the proxy manually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Network:">
    <img src="/images/android-emulators/46d26a9b-d6a0-43d3-a6ed-25013bc20735.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />

    Tap on Internet and click on gear icon on connected network name to open its settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Modify Network Settings:">
    <img src="/images/android-emulators/ddd4096d-87e5-483f-9462-98167d3b0805.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />

    * At the top right of screen click the edit icon

    * Enable "Advanced Options" if needed.

    * Set the **Proxy** to "Manual."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Proxy Details, input the following:">
    <img src="/images/android-emulators/4e7ef324-3a2a-40fc-9bdf-5abc57b11b41.jpeg" align="center" fullwidth="false" />

    * **Proxy Hostname:** Use the IP shown in the Requestly Desktop App (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).

    * **Proxy Port:** Use the port displayed in the Requestly Desktop App (e.g., `8080`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Apply the settings and continue with certificate installation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## CA Certificate Installation

To intercept HTTPS traffic, you need to install Requestly's root CA certificate on the emulator. You can do this in two ways:

**Option 1: From the Desktop:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the certificate from Requestly’’s Desktop app">
    * Open the Requestly Desktop App.

    * Navigate to **Connect Apps > Others > Manual Setup > Save Certificate** to download the root CA certificate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Certificate">
    After the certificate is downloaded on your PC, Run this script in **android studio** to push it to the emulator using the following script:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    subjectHash=`openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in **<certificate-path>** | head -n 1`
    openssl x509 -in **<certificate-path>** -inform PEM -outform DER -out $subjectHash.0
    adb root
    adb push ./$subjectHash.0 /data/misc/user/0/cacerts-added/$subjectHash.0
    adb shell "su 0 chmod 644 /data/misc/user/0/cacerts-added/$subjectHash.0"
    adb reboot
    ```

    > **Replace \<certificate-path> with the path to the downloaded certificate**
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Option 2: Directly on the Emulator:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download certificate">
    <img src="/images/android-emulators/82681f18-723a-4a0d-ae26-afad7bda1aca.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />

    * Open Chrome in an incognito tab

    * Go to [http://requestly.io/ssl](http://requestly.io/ssl) (⚠️ Use http here, not https)

    * This will download RQProxyCA.pem.cert
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install CA Certificate">
    <img src="/images/android-emulators/c3deebcd-0763-450b-917f-f7a5413f176a.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />

    * Go to **Settings > Search "CA Certificate" > Install Anyway**.

    * Select the downloaded certificate and install it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation:">
    <img src="/images/android-emulators/23464205-37f4-4320-890a-58d63b2e0c87.jpeg" align="center" fullwidth="false" />

    After installation, confirm your setup by going to [amiusing.requestly.io](http://amiusing.requestly.io)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **SSL Pinning \[if-required]**

From Android API level 23 (Android 6.0+), many apps enforce SSL pinning for security. To intercept HTTPS traffic, setting up SSL pinning is required.

<Info>
  Make sure to remove these in production builds
</Info>

Add these configs to your app codebase for it to work

**Step 1:** Add **res/xml/network\_security\_config.xml**

```xml
<network-security-config>
  <debug-overrides>
    <trust-anchors>
      <certificates src="user" />
      <certificates src="system" />
    </trust-anchors>
  </debug-overrides>

  <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <trust-anchors>
      <certificates src="system" />
      <certificates src="user" />
    </trust-anchors>
  </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

**Step 2:** Add to **AndroidManifest.xml**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest ... >
    <application android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ... >
    ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## **Deactivate Proxy (After done debugging)**

Please make sure to revert the proxy after you are done testing using Requestly

```bash
adb shell settings put global http_proxy :0
```

# **Troubleshooting**

### **Emulator not detected?**

* Check if your emulator is running?

* Check if `adb` is installed. If not, install it from [**here**](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)

* Try Restarting your emulator.

# **How does it work?**

Here's the code that makes this happen in a single click

[**https://github.com/requestly/requestly-desktop-app/blob/fb1f321a3d2431cfcd9d95d1396bcd39820a4ec9/src/renderer/actions/apps/mobile/android.js#L63-L74**](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-desktop-app/blob/fb1f321a3d2431cfcd9d95d1396bcd39820a4ec9/src/renderer/actions/apps/mobile/android.js#L63-L74)

1. Searches for online ADB devices

2. On `Connect`

   1. Root the device (To install Requestly CA)

   2. Inject Requestly CA (if not already)

   3. Setup Proxy on Emulator

   4. Restart the Emulator (Only first time)

3. On `Disconnect` - Removes the Proxy
