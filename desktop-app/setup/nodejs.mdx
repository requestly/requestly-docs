3. If the command succeeds, you should see `Requestly interception` enabled in your terminal.

# Testing Proxy

1. Go to `Network Traffic` tab in Requestly Desktop App.

2) Now Make a curl request to [https://amiusing.requestly.io/](https://amiusing.requestly.io/) using your terminal and look for that request in the Requestly Network Interceptor.

```bash
```
