The Requestly Desktop App is a powerful **network interceptor** designed for developers. Whether you're building, testing, or debugging, it gives you the tools to intercept, inspect, and modify both **requests and responses** across your entire system

It goes beyond what browser-based tools can offer by supporting full system-level traffic interception, making it perfect for debugging desktop apps, mobile simulators, and more.

### **Install Desktop App**

The Desktop application offers additional features compared to the Browser Extension, as browser extensions are limited by security and other restrictions imposed by browsers. For example, while a browser extension cannot access local files, the Desktop app can. Here are some advantages of using the Desktop app:

1. It can access local files, enabling you to map files in mock responses.

2. The Desktop app can set up system-wide or application-level proxies, allowing it to intercept traffic from browsers, desktop applications, and mobile apps.

3. It can intercept traffic from Android/iOS simulators.

4. It can record an application's traffic and use it to create bulk mocks.

5. It allows you to import and view HAR files easily.

## **Desktop App Interface**

The Desktop App interface closely mirrors the Web App interface, maintaining a consistent experience across platforms. However, there are some key differences from the Browser Extension:

1. **Network Traffic Tab** — Located on the left sidebar, this is the main feature of the Desktop App. It enables you to intercept traffic from desktop apps, Android simulators, iOS simulators, and even proxy traffic from mobile apps for detailed analysis.

2. **Proxy Server Indicator** — The `Proxy Server is listening` bar indicates that the proxy server is running on the Desktop App. It is used to intercept traffic from the various places mentioned above and display it in the Network Traffic table. Clicking the `Connect apps` button provides options to connect to browsers, desktop apps, mobile simulators, mobile apps, and more.

3. **Sessions** — Sessions in the Desktop App are recorded from the Network Traffic table, making them slightly different from the Web App. These sessions can be used for reference or to create bulk mocks.

4. Apart from these differences, the rest of the interface remains the same as the Web App.

The Desktop App’s additional capabilities make it ideal for scenarios requiring non-browser traffic interception and advanced mocking.
