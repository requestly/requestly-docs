The Requestly Browser Extension is a lightweight yet powerful tool designed for developers working on **browser-based workflows**.

Requestly’s browser extension is available for all major browsers including **Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Arc**, and **Opera**.

With the Browser Extension, you can:

- Intercept and modify network requests directly in your browser
- Use the in-browser **Network Inspector** and **API Client**
- Capture rich debugging data (console logs, network logs, screen recordings)
- Connect with the Desktop App for enhanced capabilities like bulk mocking

The extension uses your browser’s native network APIs, which means **no conflicts with VPNs or proxies** — and it runs seamlessly without installing any system-level tools.

### **Extension Popup**

You can open the Requestly Extension popup by clicking its icon in the browser’s extensions list or top bar if pinned. We recommend pinning the Requestly Extension for quick access.

The pop-up serves several purposes:

1. The first section includes the **Running Status toggle** to turn the extension on/off and an **Open App** button to launch the Requestly app ([`https://app.requestly.io/`](https://app.requestly.io/)) for creating rules or accessing the API Client.
2. The second section helps manage rules. Pinned rules and recently used rules appear for quick access. The **Executed Rules** tab shows rules applied to the current page. You can toggle rules using the toggle button and quickly create new ones using the button in the top-right corner.
3. The third section is for reporting webpage issues with detailed information, including screen recordings, console logs, network logs, local storage, and environment details. `Record this tab` starts recording, and `Watch last 5 min replay` shows recent activity, enabled via the **Configure** option. Data is stored locally and doesn’t affect performance unless shared.

   You can click on `Record this tab` and check out the working of this feature quickly.
4. The last section, visible only if the Desktop App is running, lets you intercept browser traffic via the desktop app. Click **Connect** to link the browser profile to the app, useful for tasks like bulk mocking.

### **Web App**

The Web App can be accessed using the `Open App` button in the Extension Popup or by visiting [`https://app.requestly.io/`](https://app.requestly.io/) directly in your browser. The app is organised into six main sections, represented by icons on the left sidebar:

1. **Home**: The homepage provides an overview of your resources and quick access to key actions.
2. **Network Inspector**: Similar to the browser’s dev tools, but with additional features.
3. **HTTP Rules**: Allows you to override network requests by modifying parts of the request or redirecting them—our most popular feature.
4. **Sessions**: Contains saved sessions from the Extension Popup discussed earlier.
5. **File Server**: Allows you to host custom files (JSON, JS, CSS) in the cloud and generate shareable endpoints.
6. **API Client**: Offers an intuitive interface to create, manage, and call APIs.

Each section is explained in detail in its respective documentation. Visit Network Inspector, HTTP Rules, Sessions, File Server, and API Client for a deeper dive.
