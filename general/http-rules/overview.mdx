Requestly's HTTP Rules offer a powerful suite of tools to customize, test, and manage HTTP(S) traffic. Whether you're a developer, tester, or QA professional, these rules provide an easy way to manipulate requests and responses. Below, you'll find an introduction to each HTTP Rule with links to detailed guides.

## HTTP Rules

### Modify Request Body

Adjust outgoing API request payloads to meet testing and development requirements. Add static or dynamic data to refine request structures. See details in the [Modify Request Body guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/modify-request-body).

### Modify API Response

Simulate API responses to test scenarios and edge cases. Use static data or dynamic transformations to validate application behavior. Learn more in the [Modify API Response guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/modify-response-body).

### Modify Headers

Add, remove, or modify HTTP headers for debugging and control. Get started with the [Modify Headers guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/modify-headers).

### Cancel Request Rule

Block specific network calls or simulate failure scenarios. Explore capabilities in the [Cancel Request Rule guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/cancel-rule).

### Modify Query Params

Add, remove, or modify query parameters to refine API requests. Learn more in the [Modify Query Params guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/modify-query-params).

### Modify User Agents

Test different browser and device environments by customizing User-Agent headers. Check out the [Modify User Agents guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/modify-user-agents).

### Redirect Request

Redirect requests to different URLs to switch environments or resources during development. The <a target="_blank" href="/general/http-rules/rule-types/redirect-rule">Redirect Request guide provides details</a>.

### Replace String Rule

Modify URLs or paths by replacing specific substrings. Learn more in the [Replace String Rule guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/replace-strings).

### Insert Script

Inject JavaScript or CSS into web pages for advanced customization. Get started with the [Insert Script guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/insert-scripts).

### Delay Network Requests

Simulate real-world network latencies by introducing delays. Configure delays using the [Delay Network Requests guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/delay-network-requests).

### Map Local

Serve files from your local environment to test offline changes. Start mapping files in the [Map Local guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/map-local).

### Map Remote

Redirect requests to different servers or environments for advanced testing. Learn how in the [Map Remote guide](/general/http-rules/rule-types/map-remote).

Source conditions in Requestly allow you to define criteria for matching network requests, enabling precise rule application. These criteria include URL, host, or path matching, supporting advanced filters like resource type and HTTP methods. Learn more in the [Source Conditions guide](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/source-conditions).

### GraphQL Support

Modify GraphQL requests and responses for flexible API interactions. Check out the [GraphQL Support guide](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/graphql-modify-request-response).

### Test this Rule

**Test This Rule** feature in the HTTP Rules section lets you validate rule configurations in real-time by applying them to a specific webpage or endpoint. Learn more in the [Test This Rule guide](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/test-rules).

### Shared State

Enable advanced workflows by sharing data between rules. Learn more in the [Shared State guide](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/shared-state).

### Pause/Resume Requestly

Pause and Resume in Requestly lets you temporarily disable its functionality to test your website's original behavior without interference. Learn more in the [Pause and Resume guide](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/pauseresume-requestly).

### Rules Status Syncing

Rules status syncing ensures consistent rule statuses across shared workspaces, automatically applying changes made by any member. Ideal for teams with non-technical roles, it guarantees universal configurations. Learn more in the [Rules Status Syncing guide](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/rules-status-syncing).
