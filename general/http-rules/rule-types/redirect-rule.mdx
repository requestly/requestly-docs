***

The **Redirect Request Rule** in Requestly allows you to seamlessly redirect HTTP requests to a different URL or resource. This is particularly useful for testing, debugging, or even for creating workarounds during development.

## Why Use the Redirect Rule?

1. **Redirect Production to Local Environment:** Map your production scripts or APIs to your local running code and test your local code directly on production sites without deployment.\

2. **Test API version changes**: If a new API version is available, you can test backward compatibility by setting up a redirect rule to point all URLs from the old version to the new one. This lets you test the upgrade without modifying your code.\

3. **Swap Javascript from production to staging/dev environment:** Test your dev implementation in tag manager scripts like Adobe DTM, Tealium Tag, and Google Tag Manager Containers before pushing them live on client websites.

## **How to Configure the Redirect Rule**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open HTTP Rules and Create a New Rule">
    Navigate to the HTTP Rules tab in the web or desktop app. Click on `+ New Rule` and select `Redirect Rule` from the options.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Name and Describe Your Rule">
    Provide a **descriptive name** for the rule to keep your setup organised. Optionally, add a **brief description** explaining its purpose for easier identification later.

    <img src="/images/redirect-rule/0a00e09e-ec94-4915-86bf-b02f5780b0d3.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />
  </Step>

  <Step title=" Define the Source Condition">
    Define where the rule should be applied by specifying criteria such as **URL**, **Host**, or **Path**. You can choose from options like **Regex**, **Contains**, **Wildcard**, or **Equals**, or use <a target="_blank" href="/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/advance-filters">Advance Filters</a> for more precise conditions.

    For more details on source conditions, [read this guide](/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/advance-targeting).

    <Card title="Example :">
      For this example, we are using the <a target="_blank" href="https://requestly-playground.com/">Requestly Playground</a> (a demo eCommerce Store) to demonstrate the `Redirect Request` rule. This gives you a near-live experience of how the rule works.

      In this case, we are targeting API requests that fetch data for the page, specifically those with query parameters like `type.slug:bakery`.

      * **Condition Type:** URL

      * **Operator:** Contains

      * **Value:** `https://rest.requestly-playground.com/api/products?searchJoin=and&with=type%3Bauthor&limit=30&language=en&search=type.slug:bakery%3Bstatus:publish`
    </Card>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify the Redirect Target">
    Set the target URL to which requests should be redirected. You can use the following options:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="URL">
        To redirect requests from one API endpoint to another, set the following:

        * **Source URL**: `https://rest.requestly-playground.com/api/products?searchJoin=and&with=type%3Bauthor&limit=30&language=en&search=type.slug:bakery%3Bstatus:publish`

        * **Redirect Target**: `https://rest.requestly-playground.com/api/products?searchJoin=and&with=type%3Bauthor&limit=30&language=en&search=type.slug:gadget%3Bstatus:publish`

        In this case, we are changing the query parameter `type.slug:bakery` in the **Source URL** to `type.slug:gadget` in the **Redirect Target**. This redirects requests for bakery products to a new endpoint for tech products.

        You can also import this rule and apply it directly by using this <a target="_blank" href="https://app.requestly.io/rules/shared-lists/viewer/d599a7a833ac4030a377e9c96d8bf5c2-redirect-1745477771407">shared list</a>**.**
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Local File">
        > The local file option is available only in the [desktop app](https://requestly.com/downloads).

        To redirect an API request to a local file, choose **File from your device** as the redirect target. This will serve the response from your local file instead of the live server.

      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Pick From Files Server">
        You can redirect API requests to a custom response hosted on **Requestly’s File Server**.

        Choose from an existing **JSON file** or upload a new one.

        <img src="/images/redirect-rule/401d8bd0-92af-4baa-99ab-d7d6ec216dbf.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />

        Once selected, the request will return the hosted response instead of hitting the live server.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Activate the Rule">
    Once you are satisfied with your configuration, click `Save` to store the rule. After saving, make sure to toggle the rule `ON` to activate it. This will apply the rule and ensure it works as expected.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Rule">
    To verify that the rule is working, click the `Test button`, enter a relevant URL, and then click `Test Rule`.

    You can use the following URL to test the redirection: `https://www.requestly-playground.com/?rq-category=redirect`.
