Cancel Request Rule is a feature used to block network requests, allowing users to avoid distractions or test specific error scenarios effectively. This guide explains how to configure and utilize the Cancel Request Rule in your workflow.

## Why Use Cancel Request Rule?

* **Blocking Distracting Websites:** Leverage the Cancel Rule to block access to websites such as YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook to stay focused. Set the source condition to match the URLs of these websites and enable the rule.

* **Testing Error Scenarios:** Simulate real-world application behaviors when resources are unavailable. For example, block a specific non-critical API request and observe how your application handles the missing resource.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open HTTP Rules and Create a New Rule">
