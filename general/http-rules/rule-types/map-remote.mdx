***

The Map Remote feature allows you to redirect the location of a network request to a new destination, enabling the response to be transparently served from this new location as though it were the original destination.

## Why Use Map Remote?

The Map Remote feature is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

* **Testing Local Changes on Production Sites:** Use development or staging endpoints in place of production ones without modifying the source code, allowing for seamless testing of local code.

* **Domain Switching:** Redirect traffic to a local environment for testing purposes, such as evaluating changes before deployment.

* **HTTP to HTTPS Mapping:** Easily switch between HTTP and HTTPS destinations for secure testing.

* **API Backward Compatibility:** Test the backward compatibility of new API versions by mapping requests to a different API version

## How to Use Map Remote

In Requestly, there are 2 ways you can implement a Map Remote configuration. You can utilize the two rule types: **Redirect Request** and **Replace Rule**.

### Redirect Request

The Redirect rule enables you to specify a complete URL to which a network request should be redirected. This is particularly helpful for direct mappings of entire endpoints or domains.\

### Replace Rule

The Replace rule allows you to substitute a specific part of a URL with another string. This provides greater flexibility for partial URL adjustments, such as replacing a subdomain or path segment.\
