***

Servers commonly use the **User-Agent** Request Header to identify their client's application type, operating system, software vendor, or software version. Based on the User-Agent string, the server selects suitable content to send in response. For instance, when a website opens on a mobile device, it usually looks quite compact and different from the way it opens on a desktop.

By modifying the User-Agent string, you can control how a website interprets the client accessing it. This capability is especially useful for testing and debugging applications to observe how they respond to different devices and browsers.

## Benefits of Modifying User Agents

* **Device-Specific Testing**: View and test mobile, tablet, or desktop versions of a website.

* **Browser Compatibility Checks**: Analyse how your application behaves in different browsers.

* **Debugging**: Verify if content adapts correctly based on User-Agent information.

## How to Modify User Agents in Requestly

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define the Rule Name and Description">
    Provide a **meaningful name** for the rule to keep your setup organized. Optionally, add a brief **description** to explain its purpose for easier identification later.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define the Source Condition">
    Define where the rule should be applied by specifying criteria such as **URL**, **Host**, or **Path**. You can choose from options like **Regex**, **Contains**, **Wildcard**, or **Equals**, or use <a target="_blank" href="/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/advance-filters">**Advance Filters**</a> for more precise conditions.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Device or Browser Type">
    Select the exact version or model you wish to emulate. You can either choose from the predefined options or define a custom User-Agent string to meet your testing needs.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Activate the Rule">
    Once all conditions are set, click Save to store the rule. Toggle the rule ON to activate it. You can now test your setup by visiting the targeted websites.

## Test Your Rule

<Tip>
  There are multiple ways to validate if a rule is applied or not, learn more about how to <a target="_blank" href="/general/http-rules/advanced-usage/validate-rules-execution">`validate rule execution`</a>**.**
</Tip>

Use the Test feature in Requestly to confirm the rule's behavior. Input the URL of a website and monitor how the content adapts to the new User-Agent string. This ensures that the desired changes are applied successfully.
