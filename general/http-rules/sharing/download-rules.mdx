***

Downloading HTTP rules allows you to save them locally for offline use or share them as files with others. This feature provides flexibility for scenarios where direct sharing through workspaces or Shared Lists is not possible.

## Why Use the Download Option?

* **Internal Documentation:** Maintain a local copy for internal documentation or historical reference.

* **Reusable Templates:** Use the downloaded rules as templates for creating similar configurations in other environments or projects.

* **Automation:** Automate workflows by integrating the downloaded file using Requestly's public API.

* **Backup Storage:** Safeguard your rules by keeping a backup that can be re-imported when needed.

* **Flexible Sharing:** Share the file with external collaborators who may not have direct access to your workspace or Shared Lists.
