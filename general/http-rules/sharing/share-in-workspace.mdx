Sharing rules within workspaces is a powerful feature that ensures consistency and real-time collaboration among team members. By sharing rules across workspaces, you eliminate redundancy and maintain synchronized updates, creating a seamless development environment.

## Overview of Team Workspace Collaboration

Team Workspace is a collaborative platform where team members can access, edit, and share rules in real-time. When you share rules in a workspace:

* All users in the workspace will have access to the shared rules.

* Changes made to the rules are immediately reflected for all users.

* You can transfer rules between existing workspaces or create new workspaces for specific projects or teams.
