***

A Shared List is a convenient way to share HTTP rules using a single shareable link. You can create a Shared List for team collaboration or distribution while maintaining control over accessibility.

## Key Features of Shared Lists

* **Simple Sharing:** Share multiple rules via a single link.

* **Controlled Access:** Public or private options ensure flexibility in accessibility.

* **Static State:** Shared Lists share the current state of rules and **do not update** in real-time.

## Steps to Create a Shared List

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Rules to Share">
    Go to HTTP Rules, and open "My Rules" from the left sidebar. Select the rules you want to share by using the checkboxes in the rules table.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Share Modal and Create Shared List">
    Click on the "Share" button in the toolbar above the rules table. In the "Shared List" tab of the Share modal, you can define the accessibility of the Shared List:

    1. **Public Shared List:** The link is automatically generated; just copy the link and share it with anyone to allow them to view and import the Shared List.

    2. **Private Shared List:** Requires you to add specific email addresses for users who can view and import the Shared List. After entering the email IDs, click on "Create List." An email is sent to the user, and additionally, you can copy the generated link and share it with the person. They need to log in using the same email to import the Shared List.

  </Step>
