***

The way Requestly shows rule executions varies between the browser extension and desktop app, tailored to their respective environments:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Browser Extension">
    Once you have enabled a Requestly rule to modify some part of a network request or the page, the next thing you would like to do is confirm if the rule executed successfully.

    Here are 4 ways to know if a rule is executed on a page.

    ## 1. Extension icon turns green

    If any of the rules executes on the current page, the Requestly icon in the extension toolbar (next to the address bar) will turn from a normal icon to a green icon.

    ## 2. Status Notification Widget

    A small widget appears in the **Top-right corner** of the page for **5 seconds** after the page loads or a rule is triggered.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Toggle Off the Option">
        Find the option **"Show widget when rule is applied"** and toggle it off to disable the widget popup.

        <Tip>
          Customise when the widget appears under **Show widget on**:

          * **All Rules**: Widget appears if **any rule** executes.

          * **Specific Rules**: The widget appearsÂ **only for the rules you select**.
