## Why Use Blocklist?

* **Sensitive Information:** If a website contains sensitive data, you may prefer Requestly not to modify it in any way.

* **Compatibility Issues:** In cases where Requestly disrupts the functionality of a website, you can use Blocklist to exclude the website. (If you encounter such issues, please log an issue on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues/new/choose">GitHub</a>, and the team will address it ASAP. ü§ù)
