Requestly is available as both a **browser extension** and a **desktop application**. While both platforms offer a similar set of features, their capabilities differ slightly to address platform-specific limitations and better cater to distinct use cases.

The **browser extension** is comparatively a **lighter tool** that runs directly within the browsers and is ideal for **browser-focused workflows**. The **desktop app** is designed to provide more control over network traffic across the **entire system**, including apps outside the browser. This comparison outlines functional differences to help you choose the right setup for your use case.

## Platform & Browser Support

**Browser Extension -** Supports all major web browsers, including all Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari (limited support)

**Desktop App -** Supports all browsers and any app making network requests. like desktop apps, backend services, mobile devices, etc.

> 📎 The extension runs inside the browser environment. The desktop app operates system-wide and works with any browser, application or even hardware devices like smartphones etc.

## HTTP Interception

> 🔧 Use the desktop app if you need to work with network traffic beyond the browser, such as from curl, Postman, mobile devices, or backend services.
