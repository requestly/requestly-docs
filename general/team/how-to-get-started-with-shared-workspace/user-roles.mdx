***

Requestly enhances collaboration and security by allowing workspace admins to assign specific roles to users. This role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized members can access sensitive configurations, such as API keys and authentication tokens, and helps prevent unauthorised modifications.

In this doc, you'll learn how Requestly's RBAC works, the specific roles available, the permissions associated with each role, and how to change user roles within your workspace

## How RBAC Works in Requestly

Requestly uses role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that every team member only gets access to what they need. It has three roles — **Admin**, **Editor**, and **Viewer**, each with permissions to protect sensitive data like API keys and tokens and reduce mistakes or unauthorised changes, making teamwork smoother and more efficient.

## User Roles and Their Permissions

Each workspace has three roles, each with distinct permissions:

#### **Admin**

* Full control over **workspace settings, member management, and permissions**.

* Can **create, edit, delete, and execute** Rules, APIs, and Sessions.

#### **Editor**

* Can **create, edit, delete, and execute** Rules, APIs, and Sessions.

* **Cannot** manage team settings, members, or workspace-wide configurations.

#### **Viewer**

<Tip>
  Viewers cannot edit Rules or API requests, but they can **execute** them.
</Tip>

* **Read-only access**.

* Can **view and execute** Rules, APIs, and Sessions but **cannot make any changes** or access sensitive workspace settings.
