A **workspace** in Requestly is like a project where you can store all related rules, mock APIs, API requests, and collections in one place. It helps keep everything organized and easily accessible for better management and collaboration.

### Understanding Workspaces

A Requestly workspace is like a project containing HTTP rules, API requests, Collections, and mocks. By default, you start in a private workspace, where no other user can view or access your rules.

This setup is ideal for personal projects or testing. However, you can create additional team workspaces and invite other users to collaborate in real-time, sharing rules, APIs and mocks effortlessly, or create a local workspace to keep all your data locally.

### Types of Workspaces :

Requestly offers two main types of workspaces:

**Team Workspace** - A Team Workspace is a cloud-based workspace where all your data is securely stored and synced across teams and devices. This is ideal for users who work with teams and need to keep all data in sync with their team members.

**Local workspace ( beta )** - A Local workspace stores all your data in your local machine, ensuring complete control and privacy. It is designed for individual use, rather than team collaboration. This option is suitable for users who prefer local storage over the cloud.
