Local workspace in Requestly, like <a target="_blank" href="/general/others/workspace/how-to-get-started-with-shared-workspace">
Team Workspace</a>

, is a type of workspace. The key difference is that it stores all your data on your local system, ensuring full privacy for your data. This means your collections, requests, and environment data are stored only on your device and cannot be accessed by anyone else.

<Info>
  Local Workspace is currently in **early beta** and available only for the API Client **on the desktop app**. Since it’s still in development, some features may not work as expected.

  Want to try it out? **Email us at** [**contact@requestly.io**](mailto:contact@requestly.io) **to get early access!**
