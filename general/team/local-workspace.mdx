Local workspace in Requestly, like <a target="_blank" href="/general/others/workspace/how-to-get-started-with-shared-workspace">Team Workspace</a>, is a type of workspace. The key difference is that it stores all your data on your local system, ensuring full privacy for your data. This means your collections, requests, and environment data are stored only on your device and cannot be accessed by anyone else.

<Info>
  Local Workspace is currently in **early beta** and available only for the API Client **on the desktop app**. Since it‚Äôs still in development, some features may not work as expected.

  Want to try it out? **Email us at** [**contact@requestly.io**](mailto:contact@requestly.io) **to get early access!**

## **Known Limitations üöß**

Since **Local Workspaces** are currently in **beta**, some features are not yet available:

* **Only API Client is Supported** ‚Äì Local Workspaces are available only for the API Client; other Requestly features are not supported.

* **Delete Workspace** ‚Äì There is no option to delete a Local Workspace from the UI.

We are actively working on improving Local Workspaces and will address these limitations in future updates. If you have any feedback or need support, please reach out to [**contact@requestly.io**](mailto:contact@requestly.io).
