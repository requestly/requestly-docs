Requestly’s **Team/Shared Workspaces** make collaboration easy by **syncing** all the **workpace data** between members can work together on **HTTP rules, mock APIs, the API client, and sessions**. Whether you're debugging, testing, or managing API workflows, a shared workspace ensures your team stays in sync and productive.
