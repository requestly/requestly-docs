Whether you’re a developer, QA engineer, or anyone working with HTTP requests and APIs, Requestly can help you intercept and analyze network traffic in real-time. This makes debugging issues or testing changes easier without touching the code.

## How does Requestly Interceptor work?

Requestly HTTP interceptor is a web proxy that runs on your computer. By routing network requests through Requestly, you can intercept all the network traffic made by the browser or your application.

Reading and modifying any web request and response opens up a world of possibilities for debugging and analyzing your application. You can:

* **Pinpoint Issues**: Identify network errors, slow responses, or missing resources.

* **Test Edge Cases**: Simulate server errors or unexpected payloads.

* **Inject Mock Data**: Replace live responses with custom data.

* **Optimize APIs**: Refine requests to enhance performance.

## Ways to intercept HTTP traffic

Requestly offers two flexible ways to intercept HTTP traffic depending on your workflow and use case:

### 1. **Browser extension**

The **Requestly browser extension** lets you intercept and modify HTTP traffic directly inside your browser—perfect for front-end development and quick debugging.

* **Best for**: Intercepting and modifying traffic in the browser

* **Works across**: Web pages, browser-based applications

### 2. **Desktop app**

The **Requestly Desktop App** runs a local proxy server that intercepts HTTP(S) traffic from any source, not just the browser. It’s designed for more advanced and system-wide debugging needs.

* **Best for**: Advanced use cases, mobile and backend debugging

* **Works across:** Browsers, mobile devices, emulators, terminal, Node.js, and system-wide applications

**Platform-specific setup guides:**

* [Browser Interception](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/browser-interception) - Configure Requestly with popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc

* [Android devices](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/android-devices) - Intercept Traffic from your Android smartphones and tablets[.](/general/http-interceptor/browser-interception)

* [Android emulator](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/android-simulator-interception) - Configure Android emulators in Android Studio.

* [iOS Devices](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/ios-devices-interception) - Set up your iPhones and iPads to intercept their traffic

* [iOS Emulator](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/ios-simulator-interception) - Use Requestly with iOS simulators in Xcode.

* [Node.js](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/nodejs) - Integrate Requestly with Node.js applications to debug server-side network requests and responses during development or testing

* [Terminal](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/terminal) - Use Requestly with command-line tools or scripts to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests for automation and debugging.

* [Systemwide proxy](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app/desktop-app-interception) - Configure Requestly as a systemwide proxy to capture and manipulate traffic across all applications and devices connected to your network.

Once interception is set up, you can explore and debug traffic in the [**network table**](/general/http-interceptor/network-table), [export HAR files](/general/sessions/import-view-har-file), [save sessions](/general/sessions/record-api-sessions), and [create rules](/general/http-rules/rule-types) to simulate responses or rewrite requests in real-time.
