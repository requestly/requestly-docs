***

When working with iOS apps, debugging HTTP requests can be challenging. Requestly offers an easy-to-use solution for monitoring, modifying, and debugging HTTP requests and responses during development or QA testing. Once you're familiar with the HTTP Interceptor and network table, you can follow step-by-step instructions to set up Requestly for intercepting network traffic on your iOS Simulator, ensuring a fully functional interception setup for your iOS app development needs.

<Info>
  iOS Simulator interception is only supported on the Desktop App.

## **Setup iOS Simulator for Interception**

The **iOS Simulator** is a virtual device that runs on a Mac desktop or laptop, and its proxy setup for HTTP interception is similar to that of a physical device. Since the simulator runs locally on your Mac, Requestly offers an added advantage by enabling a seamless, **one-click setup** for interception.

### One-click Simulator Setup for Interception

**Step 1**: Launch the iOS Simulator for your app.

<Info>
  Make sure the simulator is running before proceeding.
</Info>

**Step 2**: In Requestly Desktop App, open **Connect Apps** Panel, switch to **Mobile apps & browsers** tab, and click **Refresh Device**. This will display all currently running simulators.

**Step 3**: Verify that your simulator appears in the list.

**Step 4**: Click **Connect All** button next to your simulator. This action will set up the proxy configuration and automatically trust the root certificate on the simulator.

**Step 5**: Once connected, you will see all network traffic being captured.

<Warning>
  This will enable system-wide proxy because iOS simulators use systems NIC directly instead of creating a virtual NIC. You will see lots of traffic from your computer and iOS, you can filter the traffic by App name.
</Warning>

### Troubleshooting

#### Simulator Not Listed in Requestly?

If you do not see your simulator listed after refreshing, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a terminal and run:">
    ```bash
    xcrun simctl
    ```

    If this command returns an error, it indicates an issue with your Xcode command-line tools.
  </Step>

  <Step title="To fix this issue, run:">
    ```bash
    sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
    ```

    This command ensures that the correct Xcode installation is selected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="After running the above command, go back to Requestly and click Refresh Device again. Your simulator should now appear in the list." />
</Steps>
