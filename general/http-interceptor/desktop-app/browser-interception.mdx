    2. Then requestly automatically installs CA certificate to your system’s certificate store.
  </Step>

* **Google Chrome (New Profile)**:

  Launch a new browser profile without any pre-configured settings, logins, or extensions. This is ideal for testing requests in a clean environment.

* **Google Chrome (Existing Profile)**:

  Use an existing Chrome profile to connect, keeping all your extensions, settings, and history intact.

* **Firefox**:

  Connect to Firefox for testing your network requests on this browser. it will launch a new profile with a clean environment.

* **Arc**:

  Arc is another modern browser supported by Requestly. You can create a new profile or use an existing one.

* **Safari**:

  Connect to the Safari browser, clicking the connect button will open a new Safari window.

<Info>
  When you launch Safari from Requestly, it sets a system-wide proxy due to technical constraints. Make sure to turn it off after done debugging
</Info>

For other browsers, find the proxy IP and port at the top of Requestly’s dashboard and refer to your browser's documentation to configure proxy settings.

## Custom Browser Launch Options

**Without Safety Checks** Disables security restrictions, allowing insecure content to run and third-party modules to load. Flags used:

* `--allow-running-insecure-content` Allows the browser to load content from websites that are not served over HTTPS.

* `--allow-insecure-localhost` Allows insecure content to be loaded from `localhost`

* `--allow-third-party-modules` Allows third-party modules (which could include extensions or custom scripts) to run even if they are not from trusted sources

**Without CORS** The `--disable-web-security` flag disables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions in the browser, allowing requests to be made across different domains without security checks, to learn more on cors check out our blogpost <a target="_blank" href="https://requestly.com/blog/what-is-cors-and-how-to-bypass-it/">here</a>.

**With Custom Arguments**

Launch the browser with custom flags (only supported for Chromium-based browsers). Here are some interesting flags for launching Chromium-based browsers with custom arguments:

`--incognito`: Launches Chromium in Incognito mode by default.

`--window-size`: Sets the initial window size. Provided as a string in the format "800,600".

`--user-agent` : A string used to override the default user agent with a custom one.
