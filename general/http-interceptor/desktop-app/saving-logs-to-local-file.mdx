For external scripts to work on top of the intercepted logs you can enable savings logs to a local file.

Navigate to settings from the icon on the top right and under `Desktop Settings` there is a section for `Session Log Storage`

<Tip>
  Note: The logs do get cleared whenever app restarts

  This is done to avoid the log file from getting unnecessarily large which has shown to cause performance issues
</Tip>

The mentions the path of the file where the log is stored.

This is a `.jsonl` file where each line is an intercepted request stored as a `har` with one entry.

The request is added to the file only if the url matches any of the substrings that you add as matching strings
