**Requestly’s browser extension** is the simplest way to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses directly **within your browser**. It’s lightweight, easy to install, and perfect for debugging frontend issues or simulating API responses—without needing to run a local proxy or configure complex setups.

Whether you're a frontend developer testing new **API integrations** or a QA engineer simulating error scenarios, the browser extension gives you powerful tools right in your development environment.

### Key benefits

* **No proxy setup required** – Works entirely within the browser.

* **Quick debugging** – Instantly view, rewrite, or mock API requests.

* **Cross-browser support** – Available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and more.

* **Secure and isolated** – Only affects traffic in the browser you install it on.

### When to use the browser extension

Use the browser extension if:

* You only need to intercept traffic from websites or web apps.

* You’re testing frontend behavior and want a quick setup.

* You want to create rules to mock APIs, rewrite URLs, inject scripts, or modify headers.

### How to intercept traffic using the extension

Once the browser extension is installed, you can start intercepting traffic with just a few clicks.

Follow the Browser Interception guide to get started →

This guide walks you through launching a connected browser, viewing traffic in the network table, and verifying the proxy setup.
