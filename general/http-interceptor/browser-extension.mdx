**Requestly’s browser extension** is the simplest way to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses directly **within your browser**. It’s lightweight, easy to install, and perfect for debugging frontend issues or simulating API responses—without needing to run a local proxy or configure complex setups.

Whether you're a frontend developer testing new **API integrations** or a QA engineer simulating error scenarios, the browser extension gives you powerful tools right in your development environment.

### Key benefits

- **No proxy setup required** – Works entirely within the browser.
- **Quick debugging** – Instantly view, rewrite, or mock API requests.
- **Cross-browser support** – Available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and more.
- **Secure and isolated** – Only affects traffic in the browser you install it on.

### When to use the browser extension

Use the browser extension if:

- You only need to intercept traffic from websites or web apps.
- You’re testing frontend behavior and want a quick setup.
- You want to create rules to mock APIs, rewrite URLs, inject scripts, or modify headers.

### How to intercept traffic using the extension

Once the browser extension is installed, you can start intercepting traffic with just a few clicks.

[Follow the Browser Interception guide to get started →](/general/http-interceptor/browser-extension/browser-interception)

This guide walks you through launching a connected browser, viewing traffic in the network table, and verifying the proxy setup.

[Requestly’s Browser Extension is a lightweight interceptor](/general/http-interceptor/browser-interception) that runs directly in your browser. It allows you to intercept, modify, and control both incoming responses and outgoing requests, making it a powerful tool for developers and testers.

## **Browser extension features**

With the browser extension, you can:

- [**Modify requests**](/general/http-rules/rule-types/modify-request-body) – Change headers, query parameters, or request methods before they’re sent.
- [**Mock responses**](/general/api-mocking/api-mocking) – Return custom JSON or status codes instead of hitting the real server.
- [**Redirect traffic – Route**](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app-interception) API calls to staging or mock URLs for flexible testing.
- [Inject](/general/http-interceptor/desktop-app-interception)[**scripts/styles**](/general/http-rules/rule-types/insert-scripts) – Add custom JavaScript or CSS into pages on the fly.
