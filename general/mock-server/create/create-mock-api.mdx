You can upload a JSON file to Requestly’s File Server and use it as a API endpoint in your application by creating a Redirect Rule, which is perfect for testing and development scenarios. Here are the steps to set it up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the File Server in Requestly Dashboard">
    From the Requestly dashboard, click on "Files" in the left menu bar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on &#x22;New file&#x22; or upload a JSON file directly.">
    This allows you to start creating a new JSON or import an existing JSON file.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the details for the New File.">

    Provide a descriptive name for the file and Configure the following options on the creation screen:

    * **Method**: Select the HTTP method to be used (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).

    * **Status**: Specify the HTTP response status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500).

    * **Content Type**: Define the content type of the response (e.g., application/json).

    * **Latency**: Optionally, add a delay (in milliseconds) to simulate network latency.

    * **Endpoint**: Define the unique path or endpoint for the File.

    * **Response Body**: Provide the body of the response in JSON or plain text.

    * **Response Headers** (optional): Add custom headers to the response as needed.

    * **Password Protection**: In the "More" dropdown, you can set a password for your JSON file. If a password is set, users must include it as a query parameter (e.g., `rq_password=<password>`) to access the file’s contents.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on &#x22;Create&#x22; to finalize your file creation.">
    Once created, you can copy the generated URL using the “Copy URL” button.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Your JSON file is now ready! Copy the generated URL to see it in action. This endpoint can be utilized in multiple ways:

* Integrate the endpoint into your application to replace live API calls during testing.

* Use tools like Postman or cURL to manually test and validate the file responses.
