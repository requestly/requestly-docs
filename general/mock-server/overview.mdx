Requestly’s **File Server** lets you upload and serve files (like JSON, JS, CSS, images, etc.) over a secure URL—perfect for local development and testing.

**Use Cases of File Server**

* Host a JSON file and use it as an API endpoint

* Redirect live CSS files to your styles hosted on the File Server

* Replace production JavaScript with development versions to test new features safely

You can use files hosted on the File Server with the [**Redirect Rule**](/general/http-rules/rule-types/redirect-rule) to map live network requests to your hosted files, making it easy to simulate APIs or override resources without changing the actual code.
