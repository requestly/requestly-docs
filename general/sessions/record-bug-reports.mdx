**Session Book** helps you capture and share detailed bug reports by recording browsing sessions along with mouse movements, clicks, network logs, console logs, environment details, and LocalStorage changes. It provides all the information developers need to reproduce and debug issues, a replacement of reproduction steps.

Let’s see how to record a bug report, save it, and share it with your team.

<Warning>
  This feature is supported in Browser Extensions only.
</Warning>

## Configure Session Recording

To begin using **Session Book**, the first thing you'll need to do is **set up your pages**. This ensures that the right pages are ready for recording.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Sessions Tab">
    Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.requestly.io/sessions">**Sessions**</a> tab from the left-hand menu in the Requestly web app.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click on **Settings**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Page Configuration">
    Choose one of the following options:

    * **All Pages**: Record sessions on all the websites you visit.

    * **Specific Pages**: Record only on specific web pages matching the criteria. Websites and web pages can be filtered based on URL or Hostname and matched using Equals, Contains, RegEx, and Wildcard conditions on the string you type in the source URL field.

          <img src="/images/record-bug-reports/632beaa5-f5ea-486b-bec9-17e7149ea3dd.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Custom Page Configuration (Optional)">
    If selecting **Specific Pages**, add the source condition, then click **Save**. You can add multiple matching conditions by clicking the **Add Page Source** button.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once everything is set up, you can **start recording a session**, which will capture all user actions like clicks, page changes, and mouse movements.

## Recording Sessions

To record a session, you can either use manual recording, where you start and stop recording sessions as needed, or auto-recording mode, which automatically captures sessions based on predefined settings.

### Auto Recording Mode

This mode captures user interactions, such as clicks, page transitions, and mouse movements, with sessions capped at 5 minutes for optimal browser performance. Sessions are temporarily stored in local storage, discarding older activity for efficiency, until saved or shared.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Webpage">
    Visit a webpage where a bug occurs or any webpage where you want to test it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Requestly Extension">
    Click the **Requestly** extension icon in your browser toolbar.

    <Tip>
      Pin Requestly to your toolbar, for faster access.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replay Recent Activity">
    Click on **Watch Last 5 Min Replay** in the popup. If you have configured Requestly to auto-record only selected domains then it will only be available on those domains.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Share">
    The recorded session draft will open in a new browser tab. There you can either save it or share it with developers.

    <Warning>
      Sessions are stored in LocalStorage of your browser until you save them on the cloud or share them by creating a link.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual Recording

If Session Recording hasn’t been pre-configured for a specific webpage, you can manually record sessions by following these steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Page to Record">
    Open the page that you want to record.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Requestly Extension">
    Open the **Requestly** extension popup from your browser toolbar.

    <img src="/images/record-bug-reports/e5a3e133-8dea-45f3-9b66-3878e0475aed.png" align="center" fullwidth="false" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Recording">
    Click the **Record this tab** button to begin capturing session data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stop and Review">
    Once you're finished, click the **Stop & Watch** button, either from the extension popup or from the Requestly widget at the bottom-left corner.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Saving a Session

After recording the session, it enters a draft state, allowing you to review and make edits. You can trim the video, add a title and description, and make any other adjustments before saving it. During this time, the session is stored in the local storage of your browser only.

  <Step title="Open the Session">
    Open the session in the extension popup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Details">
    Replay the video and review details such as:

    * Console logs

    * Network logs

    * Environment details

    * Local storage changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trim Video (Optional)">
    Optionally, you can trim the video to skip irrelevant portions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Description">
    Add a description to explain the bug or include additional information.
