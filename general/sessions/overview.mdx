Sessions provide a structured way to record, analyze, and debug user interactions and network activity. Session Book helps QA teams and customer support professionals document issues during testing and support. On the other hand, capturing API sessions is essential for developers to effectively debug, resolve issues & create bulk mocks.

Requestly supports session creation through two primary methods:

* Browser Extension’s **Session Book** for <a target="_blank" href="/general/session-book/record-bug-reports">**recording bug reports**</a>**.**

* Desktop App for <a target="_blank" href="/general/session-book/record-api-sessions">**capturing API sessions**</a>.

### Record Bug Reports with Session Book

The <a target="_blank" href="/general/session-book/record-bug-reports">Session Book</a> in Requestly streamlines bug reporting by enabling developers to record user interactions, network logs, console logs, environment details, and changes in local storage. While it supports manual recording, you can configure it for automatic recording of user activity. This ensures developers have the context needed to reproduce and resolve issues effectively. Sessions can be <a target="_blank" href="/general/session-book/access-control-of-session">shared securely,</a> offering flexible options such as private access, link sharing, or restricted visibility.

### Create API Sessions in Requestly

Requestly’s Desktop App allows developers to <a target="_blank" href="/general/session-book/record-api-sessions">capture and analyze API sessions</a> through methods like the <a target="_blank" href="/general/http-interceptor/overview">HTTP Interceptor</a>, HAR file import, and .rqly file import. These sessions can be shared with teams by <a target="_blank" href="/general/session-book/import-view-har-file">exporting and importing HAR files</a>, making it easy to collaborate, debug issues, and streamline workflows.
