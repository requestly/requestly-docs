Once you get familiar with SessionBook, you can dive into managing access control for session recordings. Requestly offers flexible **Access Control**, allowing you to decide who can view, delete, and share recorded sessions. These options ensure that your recordings are shared securely with the right people, giving you full control over who has access based on your team's needs.

## **Sharing Options for Recordings**

### **1. Private (Default Option)**

Select this option if you want to keep the recording for personal or future reference only. No one else will be able to access the recording unless explicitly shared.

<Info>
  For recordings made within workspaces, private recordings are visible only to members of that workspace.
</Info>

### **2. Anyone with the Link**

Choose this option if you want anyone on the internet to be able to access the recording. This is useful for sharing recordings with external stakeholders or collaborators.

<Warning>
  Anyone who has the link can view the recording, and no authentication is required.
</Warning>

### **3. Only with Specific People**

This option allows you to restrict access to the recording to specific individuals. It is ideal when you want to share a session with a select team or person, without making it public to others.

For recordings inside workspaces, this option ensures that the recording is visible only to those specified, as well as members of the workspace.

*Here you can enter the email of the people you'd like to share this with.*

<Tip>
  The **Start from** option allows users to set a specific timestamp for the session replay, ensuring viewers begin watching from the most relevant point instead of the default starting time.
</Tip>
