HAR ( HTTP Archive ) files store detailed information about the network requests and responses, including URLs, headers, status codes, and timings. This data is useful for diagnosing issues and analyzing web performance.

<Tip>
  **SessionBook** is an enhanced version of the HAR file feature in Requestly. It not only records HTTP traffic but also captures screen and mouse movements for a more detailed session playback.

## How to Generate a HAR File

To capture and analyze network activity, you can generate a HAR (HTTP Archive) file from any browser's developer tools. Here’s how to create a HAR file using Google Chrome:

### Step 1: Open Google Chrome

Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.

### Step 2: Open Developer Tools

Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**, or press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac).

### Step 3: Go to the Network Tab

In the Developer Tools panel, switch to the **Network** tab to begin recording network activity.

### Step 4: Start Recording Network Activity

Locate the round icon at the top-left of the Network tab:

* If the icon is **red**, recording is active.

* If it’s **gray**, click the icon to start recording.

### Step 5: Perform the Desired Action

<Tip>
  To ensure all network requests are captured, enable **Preserve log** by checking the checkbox next to it. This will keep the recorded data even if you navigate or reload the page.
</Tip>

Please navigate through the page or reload it to capture the network traffic for the action you're analyzing.

### Step 6: Save the HAR File

Once you’ve captured the network traffic, Click the **download icon** in the Network tab to save the HAR File.

> Note: If you're using the Requestly desktop app, you can also export network sessions directly from the traffic table or the Sessions tab.

## Export a HAR File from the Requestly Desktop App

You can export a `HAR file` from captured traffic using the <a target="_blank" href="/desktop-app/features/traffic-inspector">**HTTP Interceptor**</a> while monitoring browser or app traffic. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Navigate to the Network Table:

Open the **Requestly Desktop App** and go to the **Network Table** to begin monitoring traffic.

### Step 2: Connect an App:

Click the **Connect Apps** button to establish a connection between Requestly and your app.

### Step 3: Select the Traffic Source:

Choose the source from which you want to intercept traffic (e.g., browser, Android, iOS). For browser traffic, click **Open/Launch** and follow the on-screen instructions. For mobile traffic, follow the specific instructions for connecting Android or iOS.

### Step 4: Download the HAR File:

Once traffic is captured, you can either directly export the HAR file from the traffic table or save the network session and export it later from the Sessions Tab.
