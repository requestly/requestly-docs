Requestly’s API Client makes it easy to move your work across devices, collaborate with teammates, and back up your collections and environments using powerful import/export features.

This section covers everything you need to know about:

* Bringing external data into the API client (like cURL, Postman, or `.json` files)

* Exporting your collections or environments for sharing, syncing, or backup

## Supported Imports
