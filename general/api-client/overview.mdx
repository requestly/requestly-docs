Requestly's API Client offers a range of tools to help you design, manage, and test APIs effectively. Below, we introduce the key features of the API Client with links to detailed guides for each.

## **1. Design APIs**

API design involves defining how requests and responses are structured for different operations. Requestly simplifies this process by allowing you to create individual API requests, specify HTTP methods, headers, query parameters, and request bodies, and validate responses for accuracy. Learn more on the [Design APIs page](/general/api-client/design-apis).

## **2. Send API Requests**

Sending API requests is at the core of API testing. Configure HTTP methods, headers, query parameters, and request bodies to test different scenarios. Responses can be viewed in detail, including status codes, headers, and payloads. The <a target="_blank" href="/general/api-client/replay-request-from-history">History</a> feature also allows you to revisit and resend previous requests. Explore the full process of [Sending API Requests](/general/api-client/send-api-request).

## **3. API Collections**

API Collections allow you to group related API requests for better organization and collaboration. They make it easy to share a set of APIs with your team or switch environments seamlessly. Collections also support reusable variables and pre-request/post-response scripts, enhancing productivity. Learn how to create and manage [API Collections](/general/api-client/api-collections).

## **4. Using Variables**

Variables in Requestly simplify API testing and management by allowing you to replace hardcoded values with placeholders. We support different types of variables — Collection Variables, Environment Variables, and Global Variables — each serving unique purposes. Understanding these variables will help you use them efficiently. Find more details on [defining and using Variables](/general/api-client/environments-and-variables) in your projects.

## **5. Scripts (Pre & Post)**

Scripts in Requestly let you automate and customize your API workflows. **Pre-request scripts** allow you to add logic or modify requests before they are sent, such as adding timestamps or dynamic tokens. **Post-response scripts**, on the other hand, help process responses and manipulate variables that can be used in subsequent API calls. Use JavaScript to handle tasks like validating responses, saving tokens, or setting environment variables. Learn more about using [Pre & Post Scripts](/general/api-client/scripts).

## 6. **Authorization**

Authorization ensures secure access to your APIs by managing permissions and authentication. Requestly supports various authorization mechanisms, including API keys, OAuth 2.0, Bearer Tokens, and Basic Authentication. You can easily configure authorization details at the request level or apply them globally across your API Collections for consistency. This flexibility simplifies testing APIs that require authentication and helps ensure compliance with security standards. Explore more about setting up and using [Authorization](/general/api-client/authorization) in your workflows.
