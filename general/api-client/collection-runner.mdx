**Collection Runner** enables you to execute multiple saved API requests from a collection in one go, sequentially, while leveraging existing variable and scripting features. Think of it as automating a workflow of requests\
(for example: login → create resource → fetch resource) in one run.

This documentation covers how to run collections, configure variables, view results, rerun or debug, explore automation options, and export results.

### Running a Collection

Follow these steps to run a collection using the Runner:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Collection Runner">
    In the Collections sidebar, find the collection you want to execute and click the **Run** icon on menu option next to it.

      align="center"
      fullwidth="false"
    />

    _You can also click_ **_Runner_** _from collections tab_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Options">
    - **Iterations:** Number of times to execute the full collection
    - **Delay:** Wait time between requests (milliseconds)

      fullwidth="false"
    />

    If you want your collection to run with an environment, select it using the environment selector at the upper left corner, then select the environment you want to use
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Request Order or Skip">
    You can drag to reorder requests or uncheck ones you don’t want to include in this run.

      fullwidth="false"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the Run">
    Click Save and then Run . The Runner will execute each request in order.

### How a Collection Runner Works

When you execute requests using the **Collection Runner**, here’s how things work:

#### Variable Resolution

- All `{{variable}}` placeholders resolve based on their **scope**.
- **Environment variables** override values from the global scope.
- **Collection-level variables** defined earlier are available to all requests within that collection.

#### Script Execution

- **Pre-request** and **Post-response** scripts execute as usual.
- You can **set or modify variables** dynamically during the run.
- Use `rq.expect(...)` for writing **test assertions** to validate responses.

#### Viewing Run Results

Once the run completes, the Runner displays a detailed **Run Summary**, including:

- Total number of requests executed
- Tests passed and failed
- Total duration and time taken

You can click on any request in the summary to view:

- Request details - URL, headers, and body
- Response data - status, headers, and body
- The result of each test assertion
