Variable precedence in Requestly ensures that when multiple variables with the same name exist, the most relevant one is chosen based on scope. The precedence order is as follows:

> Environment Variables → SubCollection Variables → Collection Variables → Global Variables

In other words:

* Environment variables always take the highest priority and override any variable with the same name in other scopes.

* If no matching environment variable exists, Requestly checks for the variable in the collection scope.

* Global variables serve as a fallback when the variable is not found in the environment or collection scopes.

This approach simplifies managing configurations across different use cases, ensuring that environment-specific values are prioritized without interfering with globally defined values.

Or in developer's languages:

```jsx
Copyif (variable_name in environment_variables) {        //Check in environment
    return environment_variables[variable_name];
} else if (variable_name in collection_variables) {  //Check in collection
    return collection_variables[variable_name];
} else if (variable_name in global_variables) {      //Check in global
    return global_variables[variable_name];
} else {
    return null; // Variable not found in any scope
}
```

### Example Scenario

Let’s say the variable `{{base_url}}` is defined in multiple places:

| Scope         | Value                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global        | [`https://global.api.com`](https://global.api.com)         |
| Collection    | [`https://collection.api.com`](https://collection.api.com) |
| SubCollection | [`https://sub.api.com`](https://sub.api.com)               |
| Environment   | [`https://env.api.com`](https://env.api.com)               |

If you send a request inside the **SubCollection** with an active **Environment**, the variable `{{base_url}}` will resolve to [`https://env.api.com`](https://env.api.com) because **environment variables** have the highest precedence.
