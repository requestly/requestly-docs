Variable precedence in Requestly defines how a variable value is resolved when the same variable name exists in multiple scopes. The value is picked based on scope priority, ensuring the most relevant context is always applied.

## Precedence order

> Runtime Variables → Environment Variables → SubCollection Variables → Collection Variables → Global Variables

## How it works

- **Runtime variables** have the highest priority. If a runtime variable with the same name exists, it overrides all other scopes for the duration of the session.
- **Environment variables** are checked next and override SubCollection, Collection, and Global variables.
- **SubCollection variables** apply only within that SubCollection and override Collection and Global variables.
- **Collection variables** apply to all requests in the collection unless overridden by a higher scope.
- **Global variables** act as the final fallback when the variable is not found in any other scope.

This model makes it easy to reuse variables globally while still allowing precise overrides for environments, collections, or temporary runtime use cases.

## Developer style explanation

```javascript
if (variable_name in runtime_variables) {           // Check runtime
  return runtime_variables[variable_name];
} else if (variable_name in environment_variables) { // Check environment
  return environment_variables[variable_name];
} else if (variable_name in subcollection_variables) { // Check sub-collection
  return subcollection_variables[variable_name];
} else if (variable_name in collection_variables) {  // Check collection
  return collection_variables[variable_name];
} else if (variable_name in global_variables) {      // Check global
  return global_variables[variable_name];
} else {
  return null; // Variable not found in any scope
}
```

## Example scenario

Assume the variable `{{base_url}}` is defined in multiple scopes:

| Scope         | Value                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Global        | `https://global.api.com`     |
| Collection    | `https://collection.api.com` |
| SubCollection | `https://sub.api.com`        |
| Environment   | `https://env.api.com`        |
| Runtime       | `https://runtime.api.com`    |

If you send a request inside a **SubCollection** with an active **Environment**, and a **runtime variable** with the same name exists, `{{base_url}}` resolves to:

`https://runtime.api.com`

If the runtime variable is removed, the value falls back to the **environment variable**, followed by SubCollection, Collection, and finally Global based on availability.
