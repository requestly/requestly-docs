Runtime variables in Requestly are **temporary variables** that last until the session is closed. Unlike environment or collection variables, they are available globally across all workspaces.

<Tip>
  Runtime variables are the only type of variables that work **across multiple workspaces**.
</Tip>

You can choose whether variables should **persist** it’s value after restarting the app .

## Why use runtime variables?

Runtime variables are designed to give you flexibility when testing APIs across different workspaces. Some common use cases include:

* **Quick testing**: Store temporary values like access tokens or session IDs while debugging.

* **Cross-workspace usage**: Share the same variable across multiple local workspaces without redefining it each time.

* **Persistence control**: Choose whether the variable should survive after restarting the app or clear automatically for a fresh start.

<Warning>
  Runtime variables are **not synced to the cloud**. They only exist locally on your device. If you switch machines or reinstall the app, these variables will not carry over.
</Warning>

## Creating a runtime variable

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Requestly and Go to runtime variables.">
    From the sidebar, click on **Runtime variables**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new Variable">
    In the variables table, click **+ Add More** and enter the variable details:

    * **Key** – The variable name (e.g., `session_id`).

    * **Value** – The value you want to store.

    * **Type** – Select from **String**, **Number**, **Boolean**, or **Secret**.

    * **Persistent** – Toggle whether the variable should be saved across app restarts.

      * **Yes** → Keeps its value after restarting the app.

      * **No** → Clears itself automatically on restart.

## Using runtime variables

**Method 1: Insert variables directly in requests**

You can use runtime variables just like environment or collection variables. Wrap the variable name in double curly braces `{{ }}`:

[`https://api.example.com/users/{{session_id}}`](https://api.example.com/users/\{\{session_id)

**Method 2: Set variables in scripts**\
You can define or update runtime variables in the **Scripts** tab using the `rq.variables` object.

```javascript
rq.variables.set("token", "12345");
rq.variables.get("token");
```
