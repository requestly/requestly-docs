---

You can use **custom data files** (CSV or JSON) when running a collection manually in Requestly.\
This enables you to iterate through your requests using multiple sets of input values â€” without modifying your request parameters each time.

Use this feature to test APIs with dynamic inputs, such as running the same workflow for multiple users, IDs, or configurations.

### Using a Data File in Collection Runner

Follow these steps to run a collection with custom data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Collection Runner">
    In the Collections sidebar, find the collection you want to execute and click the **Run** icon next to it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Data File">
    In the Runner configuration panel, under **Test Data File**, click **Select File**.

    You can choose a **CSV** or **JSON** file from your system.

    Once added, Requestly will automatically detect the file type and preview its structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview Data and Map Variables">
    After selecting the file, click **Preview** to view your data.

    - For CSV files: verify column names and types
    - For JSON files: check object keys and structure

    Each key or column name should match the variable used in your requests, such as `{{city}}` or `{{user_id}}`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the Run">
    Click **Use File** and then **Start Run**.\
    The Collection Runner will replace variables with data from your file for each iteration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Data Files Work

When you attach a CSV or JSON file to your manual run:

- Each **row (CSV)** or **object (JSON)** represents one **iteration**
- Variables inside your requests (like `{{name}}` or `{{email}}`) are replaced with the corresponding values
- Requestly automatically cycles through each data set until all iterations are complete

### Supported File Formats

#### CSV Format

- The first row defines variable names
- Each subsequent row represents one iteration
- Each row must have the same number of columns

**Example:**

```
city,temperature  
Vancouver,10  
Austin,24  
London,12
```

#### JSON Format

- Must be an array of key-value objects
- Each object defines one iteration

**Example:**

```
[  
  { "city": "Vancouver", "temperature": 10 },  
  { "city": "Austin", "temperature": 24 },  
  { "city": "London", "temperature": 12 }  
]
```

### Example Use Case

For a request like\
`GET https://api.example.com/weather?city={{city}}`

and a data file containing\
city\
Vancouver\
Austin\
London

Requestly will automatically replace `{{city}}` with each value during the run.

### Best Practices

- Keep your file under **5 MB** for optimal performance
- Ensure variable names in your file **match exactly** (case-sensitive) with those used in your requests
- Use **Pre-request Scripts** and **Post-response Tests** to validate results across iterations
- Preview files before running to confirm correct structure and mapping

### Troubleshooting

If you face issues while running with data files:

- Ensure your file is properly formatted and saved in UTF-8 encoding
- Confirm that all required variables exist in both the collection and the data file
- Re-select or re-upload the file if it fails to parse correctly
