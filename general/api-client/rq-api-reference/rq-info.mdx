The `rq.info` object provides metadata about the current script execution context. It contains information about the request being executed, the current iteration (when running collections), and the event type.

## Methods

### `rq.info.requestId`

**Type:** `string`

The unique identifier of the request being executed.

**Example:**

```
console.log("Request ID:", rq.info.requestId);
// Output: Request ID: abc123xyz
```

### `rq.info.requestName`

**Type:** `string`

The name of the request being executed.

**Example:**

```
console.log("Request Name:", rq.info.requestName);
```

### `rq.info.eventName`

**Type:** `"prerequest" | "postresponse"`

The type of script event currently executing. Returns `"prerequest"` for pre-request scripts and `"postresponse"` for post-response scripts.

**Example:**

```
if (rq.info.eventName === "prerequest") {
    console.log("Running pre-request script");
} else {
    console.log("Running post-response script");
}
```

### `rq.info.iteration`

**Type:** `number`

The current iteration index when running a collection with the Collection Runner. The index is **0-based**, meaning the first iteration is `0`, the second is `1`, and so on.

For single request executions (not part of a collection run), this value is `0`.

**Example:**

```
console.log("Current iteration:", rq.info.iteration);
// Output: Current iteration: 0 (first iteration)
// Output: Current iteration: 2 (third iteration)
```


### `rq.info.iterationCount`

**Type:** `number`

The total number of iterations configured for the collection run. For single request executions, this value is `1`.

**Example:**

```
console.log(`Running iteration ${rq.info.iteration + 1} of ${rq.info.iterationCount}`);
// Output: Running iteration 3 of 10 
```
