description: "Learn how to import OpenAPI Specification (Swagger) files to instantly generate API collections and environments."
---

Import your **OpenAPI Specification** files directly into the **Requestly,** and instantly create organized API collections without any manual setup.

This helps you bring your existing API definitions from Swagger, Postman, or your backend documentation straight into Requestly in just a few clicks.

## What You Can Import

The importer supports both **YAML** and **JSON** OpenAPI files. When you upload a spec, Requestly automatically reads the file and creates API collections and requests based on your defined endpoints.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the API Client">
    Go to your **API Client workspace** in Requestly. Make sure you’re in the workspace where you want to import your API collection.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Your OpenAPI File">
    Click **Import → OpenAPI** and select your `.yaml` or `.json` file.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview Before Import">
    Requestly will show a preview of what will be imported — including:

    - The collections that will be created
    - The environments and variables that will be set up

    Review the preview and confirm to complete the import.

      fullwidth="false"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Requestly builds your collection">
    - Each **path** in your OpenAPI file becomes an individual **request**.
    - Requests are grouped under collections named after your API or service.
    - Requestly automatically fills in the **method, URL, headers, and body** (if defined in the spec).

      fullwidth="false"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Environments are created automatically">
    - If your spec defines multiple servers (e.g., staging, production), Requestly creates matching environments.
    - Each environment includes a `{{base_url}}` variable set to the server URL.
    - You can switch environments easily from the environment dropdown.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens After Import

Once imported, Requestly automatically maps elements from your OpenAPI file to your workspace structure.

| **OpenAPI Element**             | **Where It Appears in Requestly**                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Paths**                       | Individual requests inside the imported collection                      |
| **Methods (GET, POST, etc.)**   | Reflected automatically in each request                                 |
| **Servers (root level)**        | Creates environments with a `{{base_url}}` variable for each server URL |
| **Servers (path level)**        | Used as **collection variables in parent**                              |
| **Schemas / Components**        | Used internally for request and response structure                      |
| **Request bodies & parameters** | Automatically mapped to request body and query params                   |
