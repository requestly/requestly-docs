## Create Folders

Folders allow you to create sub-groups within a collection. They can have their own collection variables and share all the features of a collection. Folders(Sub-Collections) inherit all the collection variables from its parent. However, You can override parent-collection variables by defining a collection variable inside the sub-collection.

**Step 1:** Click on the Add Folder icon next to the collection name.

## Collection Variables

Collections include a **collection variables** feature that allows you to define and manage reusable values specific to the collection. Collection Variables are defined as key-value pairs that work as the base set of variables for collections. They can be used in API definitions with double curly braces `{{collection_variable}}`

Learn more about this feature on the [Variables](/general/api-client/environments-and-variables) page.
