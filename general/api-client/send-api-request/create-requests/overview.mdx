The API client in Requestly allows you to easily send API requests, without the need for writing code or using a terminal. It lets you test APIs, retrieve data, and explore how they work by simply creating a request, clicking Send, and viewing the response within Requestly.

This feature is perfect for developers testing API endpoints during development, QA engineers validating API responses for edge cases, and support engineers debugging API issues in real-time.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Response

Once you send a request, you'll see the response displayed in the bottom panel with the following information:

### View the Response Body

Check the response body in the **Response Body** section. You can switch between formatted (pretty) and raw views.

### Check the Response Headers

Review the headers sent back by the server in the **Headers** tab.
