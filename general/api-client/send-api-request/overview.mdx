Whether you are building and testing your own API or integrating with a third-party API, you can use Requestly to send requests and connect to the APIs you are working with. Your requests can retrieve, create, update, or delete data, and they can include parameters and authorization details.

For example, if you are building a client application such as a mobile or web app for a store, you might send one request to retrieve a list of available products, another request to create a new order with selected product details, and another request to log a customer into their account.

When you send a request, Requestly displays the API server’s response in a clear format so you can inspect, visualize, and troubleshoot it easily.

## Get Started with Sending Requests

If you have not sent a request before, review the [Sending Your First Request](/general/api-client/quick-start) guide before continuing.

Explore the topics below to learn how to send API requests in Requestly:

- To understand the basics of building requests, including selecting HTTP methods, entering URLs, and interpreting response status codes, see [Configure Request](/general/api-client/send-api-request/configure-request).

- To learn how to add query parameters, path variables, and request body data in formats such as JSON, form data, and file uploads, see [Parameters and Body Data](/general/api-client/send-api-request/parameters-and-body).

- If your API requires specific headers or authentication tokens, learn how to configure them in [Request Headers](/general/api-client/send-api-request/request-headers).

- Export requests as code snippets in multiple languages such as JavaScript, Python, and cURL. Learn more in [Generate Client Code](/general/api-client/generate-client-code).

- If your API requires identity verification or access control, review the [Authorization Guide](/general/api-client/authorization).

- Use collections to group related requests for better organization and collaboration. Learn more in [API Collections](/general/api-client/api-collections).

- Variables allow you to reuse data across requests and switch values based on environments such as development, staging, or production. See [Variables and Environments](/general/api-client/environments-and-variables).

- Add JavaScript code to run before sending requests or after receiving responses to automate workflows and extract data. Learn more in [Scripts](/general/api-client/scripts).

- Write automated tests to validate API responses and ensure reliability. See [Tests](/general/api-client/tests).

- Export requests as code snippets in multiple languages such as JavaScript, Python, and cURL. Learn more in [Generate Client Code](/general/api-client/generate-client-code).

In addition to standard HTTP requests, Requestly also supports other formats and protocols such as [GraphQL](/general/api-client/graphql-request). You can also [import from cURL](/general/api-client/import-export/import-from-curl), [migrate from Postman](/general/api-client/import-export/import-from-postman), or [import OpenAPI specifications](/general/api-client/import-export/import-openapi-spec).
