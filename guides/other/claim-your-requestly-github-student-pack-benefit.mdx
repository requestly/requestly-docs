## Verify Your GitHub Student Status

To redeem the Requestly offer, you first need an approved GitHub Education account. If you haven’t already, **apply for the GitHub Student Developer Pack** by submitting proof of enrollment (such as a school email, student ID, or transcript).

GitHub’s documentation guides you through this process: navigate to your Education benefits in GitHub settings, click “Start an application,” and submit the form. Once GitHub reviews and verifies your student status, your account will be eligible for Student Pack benefits.

## Access the Requestly Student Offer

After your GitHub account is verified, you can now **claim your Requestly benefit**:

* **Go to Requestly’s GitHub Education page:** Visit [**requestly.com/github-education**](http://requestly.com/github-education) or find Requestly on the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack#:~:text=About%20Requestly,and%20manage%20APIs).

* Click **Sign in with GitHub:** You’ll be redirected to the Requestly app. Here, click **Connect with GitHub.**

* **Login or Sign Up on Requestly:**

  * If you already have a Requestly account (using the same GitHub email), simply log in and proceed.

  * If you don’t have a Requestly account, click **Sign Up** to create one. Once your account is created, return and click **Connect with GitHub** again.

* **Benefit Activated:** Once connected, your GitHub Student verification will apply automatically, and your Requestly account will be upgraded with the Student Pack access

## Enjoy Requestly Professional

Now that you’ve redeemed the offer, you can use Requestly Professional just like any paid user, with features like advanced API interception, mocking, and testing. No further action is needed. Your free **one-year access** begins immediately upon signing in.

* **Verify your plan:** In the Requestly app or dashboard, you should see that your plan is upgraded to Professional.

* **Use Requestly:** Create rules to intercept or modify HTTP requests, mock APIs, and debug your apps. Consult the Requestly Docs for tips and tutorials.

After one year, if you’re still a student, you’ll have the option to switch to the free tier or subscribe at the regular price

*\*\* This promotional credit can only be redeemed once per student.*
