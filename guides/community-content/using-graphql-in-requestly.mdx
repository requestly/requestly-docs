## Introduction

Ever made three API calls just to load one page? Frustrating, right? That's the problem GraphQL solves.

GraphQL lets you ask for exactly what you need in one request. No more juggling endpoints or filtering out useless data. Just describe what you want, and you get it.

Requestly's API Client makes this even better. The schema loads automatically, autocomplete guides you as you type, and there's a visual builder if you'd rather click than code.

Let's dive in.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a powerful query language that gives you precise control over your API requests. Think of it as a more efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs.

**Why developers love it:**

- **No over-fetching** — Get only the fields you need, not the entire object
- **No under-fetching** — Fetch related data in one go instead of making multiple calls
- **Strongly typed** — Know exactly what data is available through the schema
- **Single endpoint** — One URL for all your operations

Instead of juggling multiple endpoints like `/users/1`, `/users/1/posts`, and `/users/1/comments`, you make one GraphQL request that gets everything you need.

## Queries and Mutations: The Two Core Operations

Think of GraphQL operations like database operations:

**Queries = Reading data** (like SELECT in SQL)

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

**Mutations = Modifying data** (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE in SQL)

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(title: "Hello", body: "World") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

That's the foundation. Now let's see how Requestly makes working with these operations effortless.

## Getting Started with GraphQL in Requestly

We'll use a free GraphQL API to explore how Requestly simplifies everything: `https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api`

This API provides a complete playground with users, posts, and comments—perfect for learning.

---

### 1. Auto Schema Fetching

Here's where Requestly shines. Open the API Client and create a new GraphQL request:

1. Paste the endpoint: `https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api`
2. Hit Enter

That's it! Requestly automatically fetches the entire schema. types, and fields. No more digging through documentation or guessing what's available.

The schema explorer shows you every query, mutation, and type definition available. Click on any type to see its fields, arguments, and relationships.

---

### 2. Writing Queries

Requestly gives you flexibility—write queries manually with intelligent autocomplete, or use the visual interface for a code-free experience.

**Manual Approach:** Type your query directly in the editor. As you type, Requestly suggests available fields and validates your query structure in real-time.

**Visual Approach:** Click the "Explorer" or "Query Builder" tab, browse available queries, check boxes next to fields you want, and watch your query build automatically.

Here's an example query to fetch user data:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      data {
        title
        body
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Click "Send" and get your response instantly.

### 3. Working with Mutations

Let's create some data. Mutations in Requestly work exactly like queries, with the same autocomplete and variable support.

```graphql
mutation CreatePost {
  createPost(
    input: {
      title: "My First Post"
      body: "Learning GraphQL is easier than I thought!"
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    body
  }
}
```

### 4. Working with Variables

Instead of hardcoding values, use variables to make your operations dynamic and reusable. This works for both queries and mutations.

**Why use variables?**

- Reuse the same operation with different values
- Handle user input from forms

**Example: Query with Variables**

```graphql
query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "userId": "2"
}
```

Need a different user? Just change `"2"` to `"5"` in the variables—no need to touch your query.

**Example: Mutation with Variables**

```graphql
mutation CreatePost($title: String!, $body: String!) {
  createPost(input: { title: $title, body: $body }) {
    id
    title
    body
  }
}
```

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "title": "My First Post",
  "body": "Learning GraphQL with Requestly!"
}
```

### 5. Multiple Operations in One Request

GraphQL allows you to define multiple operations in a single request, and Requestly makes it easy to manage them.

**How It Works**

You can write multiple queries or mutations together:

```graphql
query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}

mutation CreatePost($title: String!, $body: String!) {
  createPost(input: { title: $title, body: $body }) {
    id
    title
    body
  }
}
```

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "userId": "1",
  "title": "My Post Title",
  "body": "Post content here"
}
```

**Choosing Which Operation to Execute**

When you have multiple operations defined, Requestly shows an "Operation Name" dropdown near the Send button. Simply select which operation you want to execute:

- Select `GetUser` to fetch user data
- Select `CreatePost` to create a new post

This is incredibly useful when testing multiple operations without switching between different requests or commenting out code. You can keep all related operations together and switch between them with a single click.

## Wrapping Up

You've just learned how to work efficiently with GraphQL in Requestly. Here's what you can now do:

- **Auto-fetch schemas** — No more hunting for documentation
- **Write queries two ways** — Code or visual interface, your choice
- **Use variables** — Make dynamic, reusable queries
- **Execute mutations** — Create, update, and delete data with confidence
- **Manage multiple operations** — Keep related queries and mutations together, switch between them instantly

Requestly transforms GraphQL from complex to accessible. Whether you're a developer who loves writing queries or a team member who prefers clicking buttons, you have the tools you need.
