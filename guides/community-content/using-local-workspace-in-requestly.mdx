## Introduction

As developers, we love tools that save time, reduce friction, and give us control. Requestly has always been one of those tools — especially for testing APIs, debugging network calls, managing headers, redirects, and more.

While exploring Requestly, I stumbled upon something new that immediately grabbed my attention — Local Workspace.

At first, I assumed it was just another workspace option. But once I actually used it, I realized:

> This is a totally different way to organize and test APIs — privately, offline, and with full control.

If you’ve ever wished:

- _“I wish my API collections weren’t tied to the cloud.”_
- _“I want my requests to live locally so I can Git commit them.”_
- _“I don’t want to sync everything while experimenting.”_

… then Local Workspace might be exactly what you need.

So here’s my experience using it for the first time — step-by-step, what worked, what surprised me, and how you can try it too.

---

## 🧠 What is Local Workspace (in the simplest words)?

Local Workspace lets you create a Requestly workspace whose data is stored only on your computer — not online, not synced, not shared.

Everything stays in a folder you choose:

- Requests
- Collections
- Environments
- Response history

It’s like having Postman collections + VSCode folder + Git version control all combined.

> No team, no cloud, no login required.  
> Just you and your local machine.

This was a big win for me because I often test APIs that are still internal or experimental — now I don’t have to worry about where the data goes.

## 🚀 Setting up a Local Workspace

### Step 1 — Open Requestly

### Step 2 — Click on Workspaces

### Step 3 — Choose “New local workspace”

### Step 4 — Create a Local Workspace

Requestly will ask you for:

- A name for your workspace
- A folder location on your computer  
   _(Your APIs, variables and related metadata will be stored here)_

### Step 5 — Click Create

That’s it. No complicated setup, no onboarding screens, no permission drama.

After that, Requestly created a workspace linked to the folder I selected. Anything I did inside the API Client immediately reflected as real files in that folder.

## 🧪 Using the Local Workspace

Once inside, I started by creating my first collection and adding sample REST endpoints:

- `GET /users`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /profile`

## 📂 Creating Collections & Adding Multiple Requests

Once my Local Workspace was ready, I created a new collection to organize my API tests.

### Step 1: Create a Collection

- Click Create Collection
- Give it a name
- Example: Todo API

![Creating Collection](/images/guide-local-workspace/creating-collection.gif)

The collection instantly appeared as a structured file inside my Local Workspace — meaning everything exists as real source-controlled files, not just cloud data.  
That felt powerful.

---

### Step 2: Add Requests to the Collection

Inside _Todo API_, click:

➡️ **New Request**

You can now start adding CRUD operations for the public TODO API.

#### Example Requests I Created:

| Operation   | Method | Endpoint                                     |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Get Todo    | GET    | https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 |
| Create Todo | POST   | https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos   |
| Update Todo | PUT    | https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 |
| Delete Todo | DELETE | https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 |

### ▶️ Running Requests

Running requests works exactly the same as the cloud version:

- Writing body & headers
- Checking JSON responses
- Viewing performance, status, history

---

## 🗑 Deleting a Local Workspace (Clean-Up Step)

After experimenting with different collections and requests, you might want to clean up your environment — maybe to start fresh or remove unused workspaces. Requestly makes it super simple to delete a Local Workspace safely.

Here’s how I deleted mine when I was done testing:

---

### Steps to Delete a Local Workspace

1. Open Requestly Desktop App
2. Click on the name of your workspace
3. Hover over the Local Workspace you want to delete and click _Settings_

![Selecting Workspace](/images/guide-local-workspace/selecting-workspace.png)

4. Click **Delete Workspace**

![Delete Workspace](/images/guide-local-workspace/delete-workspace.png)

---

### Delete Options

#### Option 1: Delete workspace (from app only)

This removes the workspace from the Requestly interface, but keeps the underlying files safe locally so you can reopen or import them later.

#### Option 2: Also delete all related files and folders from this device

Ticking this checkbox permanently deletes:

- Workspace folder
- Request files
- Collections
- Tests / scripts

⚠ Warning: This action cannot be undone.

Write the name of your workspace and confirm deletion.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Using Local Workspace changed how I think about API testing.  
It feels clean, private, fast, and developer-friendly.

Instead of juggling messy exported JSON collections or cloud sync, I now have:

- Organized local collections
- Requests stored as real readable files
- API testing that stays with my project’s source code

Honestly — if you’re a backend or full-stack dev, you should try this immediately.
