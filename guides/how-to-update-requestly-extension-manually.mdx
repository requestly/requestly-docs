If Chrome hasn't auto-updated Requestly yet, here's how to force the latest version instantly.

By default, Chrome automatically updates extensions when a new version is published to the Chrome Web Store. However, this process can take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days.

If you want to update the Requestly extension immediately, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Extensions Page">
    Go to your Chrome browser and type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar. Hit Enter.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Developer Mode">
    In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle on **Developer mode**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Requestly">
    Use the search bar at the top to search for “Requestly.”
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the Update Button">
    On the Requestly extension card, click the **Update** button. Chrome will fetch and install the latest version.
