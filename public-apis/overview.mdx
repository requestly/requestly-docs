    The API is currently in **BETA**. To access it, you need an API key:

    * Each API key is linked to a specific workspace.

    * API keys cannot access rules or data outside the associated workspace.

    Request your API key by filling out a <a target="_blank" href="https://app.formbricks.com/s/clryn62s316gjdeho9j03t7oa">simple form</a>. Our team will review your request and provide access shortly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authentication">
    Use your API key to authenticate API requests. Include the key in the header of every request:

    ```jsx
    x-api-key: <API-KEY>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Structure and Usage

The Requestly API is designed with simplicity and scalability, offering a structured rule and group management approach. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its organization and capabilities

### **Rule Management**

The core functionality of the API revolves around rule management. With these endpoints, you can programmatically manage every aspect of your rules:

* <a target="_blank" href="/public-apis/create-rule">**Create Rules**</a>: Add rules for Redirects, Replace Operations, Headers Modifications, Query Parameters, User-Agent Changes, Delays, and more.

* <a target="_blank" href="/public-apis/update-rule">**Update Rules**</a>: Modify existing rules to reflect new requirements or changes.

* [**Retrieve Rules**](/public-apis/get-rule) :

  * Fetch all rules in your workspace.

  * Retrieve specific rules using unique identifiers.

* [**Delete Rules**](/public-apis/delete-rule): Remove outdated or unused rules to keep your workspace organized.

### **Groups Management**

Efficiently organize your rules by creating and managing groups. The following endpoints are available:

* [**Create a Group**](/public-apis/create-group): Define new groups to categorize rules.

* [**Retrieve Groups**](/public-apis/get-group): Fetch a list of all groups in your workspace.

* [**Update Group Details**](/public-apis/update-existing-groups): Modify the properties of an existing group.

* [**Delete a Group**](/public-apis/delete-group): Remove groups that are no longer needed.
